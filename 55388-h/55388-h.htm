<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:1em;'>(<span class='it'>Continued from page 213.</span>)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader, the heart of man is a strange compound, a
deceitful thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jasper St. Aubyn <span class='it'>did</span> love Theresa Allan, as I have
said before, with all the love which he could bestow
on any thing divine or human. His passion for the
possession of her charms, both personal and mental,
was, as his passions ever were, inordinate. His belief
in her excellence, her purity, in the stability of her
principles, the impregnable strength of her virtue,
could not be proved more surely than by the fact,
that he had never dared an attempt to shake them.
His faith in her adoration for himself was as firm-fixed
as the sun in heaven. And, lastly, his conviction of
the constancy of his own love toward her, of the impossibility
of that love’s altering or perishing, was
strong as his conviction of his own being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was one of those singularly constituted beings,
who will never take an easy path when he has the
option of one more difficult; never follow the straight
road when he can see a tortuous byway leading to
the same end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had his father, as he pretended, desired to thwart
his will, or prevent his marriage with Theresa, for
that very cause he would have toiled indefatigably, till
he had made her his own in the face of day. Partly
swayed by a romantic and half chivalrous feeling,
which loved to build up difficulties for the mere pleasure
of surmounting them, partly urged on by pure
willfulness and recklessness of temper, he chose evil
for his good, he rushed into deceit where truth would
in fact have served his purpose better. A boyish love
of mystery and mischief might probably have had its
share likewise in his strange conduct, and a sort of
self-pride in the skill with which he managed his plot,
and worked the minds of older men into submission to
his own will. Lastly, to compel Theresa to this sacrifice
of her sense of duty and propriety, to this abandonment
of principle to passion, appeared to his perverted
intellect a mighty victory, an overwhelming proof of
her devotedness to his selfish will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If there were any darker and deeper motive in his
mind, it was unconfessed to himself; and, in truth, I
believe, that none such then existed. If such did in
after times grow up within him, it arose probably from
a perception of the fatal facility which that first fraud,
with its elaborate deceits had given him for working
further evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Verily, it is wise to pray that we be not tempted.
The perilous gift of present opportunity has made many
an one, who had else lived innocent, die, steeped to
the very lips in guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the actuating motives of <span class='it'>his</span> conduct;
of hers pure love, and the woman’s dread of losing
what she loved, by over-vehement resistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the dead of a dark, gusty night in autumn, when
the young moon was seen but at rare intervals between
the masses of dense driving wrack which swept continuously
across the leaden-colored firmament before
the wailing west winds, when the sere leaves came
drifting down from the great trees, like the ghosts of
departed hopes, when the long mournful howl of some
distant bandog baying the half seen moon, and the dismal
hootings of the answered owls, were the only
sounds abroad, the poor girl stole, like a guilty creature,
from her virgin chamber, and, faltering at every
ray of misty light, every dusky shadow that wavered
across her way, as she threaded the long corridors,
crept stealthily down the great oaken staircase, and
joined her young lover in the stone hall below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her palfrey and his hunter stood saddled at the foot
of the terrace steps, and, almost without a word exchanged
between them, she found herself mounted and
riding, with her right hand clasped in his burning
fingers, through the green chase toward the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
The clock was striking midnight—ill-omened hour
for such a rite as that—in the tower of the parish
church, as Jasper St. Aubyn sprung to the ground before
the old Saxon porch, and lifting his sweet bride
from the saddle, fastened the bridles of their horses to
the hooks in the churchyard-wall, and entered the low-browed
door which gave access to the nave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A single dim light burned on the altar, by which the
old vicar, robed in his full canonicals, awaited them,
with his knavish assistant, and the two witnesses beside
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dully and unimpressively, at that unhallowed hour,
and by that dim light, the sacred rite was performed,
and the dread adjuration answered, and the awful bond
undertaken, which, through all changes, and despite
all chances of this mortal life makes two into one flesh,
until death shall them sever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gloom, the melancholy, the nocturnal horror of
the scene sunk deeply on Theresa’s spirit; and it was
in the midst of tears and shuddering that she gave her
hand and her heart to one, who, alas! was too little
capable of appreciating the invaluable treasure he had
that night been blessed withal. And even when the
ceremony was performed, and she was his immutably
and forever, as they rode home as they had come,
alone, through the dim avenues and noble chase, which
were now in some sort her own, there was none of
that buoyancy, that high, exulting hope, that rapture
of permitted love which is wont to thrill the bosoms
of young and happy brides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor, on the following day, was the melancholy
gloom, which, despite all her young husband’s earnest
and fond endeavors to cheer and compose her, still
overhung her mind, in anywise removed by the tidings
which reached the manor late in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aged vicar, so the tale went, had been called by
some unusual official duty to the parish church, long
after it was dark, and in returning home had fallen
among the rocks, having strayed from the path, and injured
himself so severely that his life was despaired of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So eagerly did Jasper proffer his services, and with
an alacrity so contrary to his usual sluggishness, when
his own interests were not at stake, did he order his
horse and gallop down to the village to visit his old
friend, that his father smiled, well pleased and half
laughingly thanked Theresa, when the boy had gone,
saying that he really believed her gentle influence was
charming some of Jasper’s willfulness away, and that
he trusted ere long to see him, through her precept and
example, converted into a milder and more humanized
mood and temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something swelled in the girl’s bosom, and rose to
her throat, half choking her—the <span class='it'>hysterica passio</span> of
poor Lear—as the good old man spoke, and the big
tears gushed from her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was by the mightiest effort only that she kept down
the almost overmastering impulse which prompted her
to cast herself down at the old man’s feet, and confess
to him what she had done, and so implore his pardon
and his blessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had she done so, most happy it had been for her unhappy
self; more happy yet for one more miserable
yet, that should be!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had she done so, she had crowned the old man’s
last days with a halo of happiness that had lighted him
down the steps to the dusky grave rejoicing—she had
secured to herself, and to him whom she had taken for
better or for worse, innocence and security and self-respect
and virtue, which <span class='it'>are</span> happiness!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did it not; and she repented not <span class='it'>then</span>—for when
she told Jasper how nearly she had confessed all, his
brow grew as dark as night, and he put her from him,
exclaiming with an oath, that had she done so, he had
never loved her more; but did she not repent thereafter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late when Jasper returned, and he was, to
all outward observers, sad and thoughtful; but Theresa
could read something in his countenance, which told
<span class='it'>her</span> that he had derived some secret satisfaction from
his visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a word, the danger, apprehension of which had
so prompted Jasper’s charity, and quickened his zeal
in well-doing—the danger, that the old clergyman
should divulge <span class='it'>in extremis</span> the duty which had led
him to the church at an hour so untimely, was at an
end forever. He was dead, and had never spoken
since the accident, which had proved fatal to his decrepit
frame and broken constitution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, to make all secure, he had seen the rascal
sexton, and secured him forever, by promising him an
annuity so long as the secret should be kept; while
craftier and older in iniquity than he, and suspecting—might
it not be foreseeing—deeper iniquity to follow,
the villain, who now alone, with the suborned witnesses,
knew what had passed, stole into the chancel,
and cut out from the parish register the leaf which
contained the record of that unhappy marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is marvellous how at times all things appear to
work prosperously for the success of guilt, the destruction
of innocence; but, of a truth, the end of these
things is not here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It so fell out that the record of Theresa Allan’s
union with Jasper St. Aubyn was the first entry on a
fresh leaf of the register. One skillful cut of a sharp
knife removed that leaf, so as to defy the closest scrutiny;
had one other name been inscribed thereon, before
hers, she had been saved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! for Theresa!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to do Jasper justice, he knew not of this villainy;
nor, had he known, would he <span class='it'>then</span> have sanctioned
it. He only wished to secure himself against momentary
discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ill consequences of this folly, this mysterious and
unmeaning craft, had now in some degree recoiled
upon himself. And delighting, as he really did, in the
closest intercourse with his sweet young bride, he
chafed and fumed at finding that the necessity of keeping
up the concealment, which he had so needlessly
insisted on, precluded him from the possibility of enjoying
his new possession, as he would, entirely and
at all hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have given almost his right hand now to
be able to declare openly that she was his own. But,
for once in his life, he dared not! He could not bring
himself to confess to his kind father the cruel breach
of confidence, the foul and causeless deceit of which
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
he had been guilty; and he began almost to look forward
to the death of that excellent and idolizing parent,
as the only event that could allow him to call his wife
his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not long before his wish—if that can be called
a wish, which he dared not confess to his own guilty
heart, was accomplished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first snows had not fallen yet, when the old
cavalier fell ill, and declined so rapidly that before the
old year was dead he was gathered to his fathers.
As he had lived, so he died, a just, upright, kindly,
honorable man. At peace with all men, and in faith
with his God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His last words were entreaty to his son to take
Theresa Allen to his wife, and to live with her unambitiously,
unostentatiously, as he had lived himself,
and was about to die, at Widecomb. And even then,
though he promised to obey his father’s bidding, the
boy’s heart was not softened, nor was his conscience
touched by any sense of the wrong he had done. He
promised, and as the good man’s dying eye kindled
with pleasure, he smiled on him with an honest seeming
smile, received his parting kiss, and closed his eyes,
and stood beside the dead, unrelenting, unrepentant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was the Lord of Widecomb; and so soon as
the corpse by which he stood should be composed in
the quiet grave, the world should know him, too, as
the Lord of Theresa Allan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so he swore to her, when he stole that night,
as he had done nightly since their marriage, to her
chamber, after every light was extinguished, and, as
he believed, every eye closed in sleep; and she, fond
soul! believed him, and clasped him to her heart, and
sunk into sleep, with her head pillowed on his breast,
happier than she had been since she had once—for the
first, last time—deviated from the paths of truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he who has once taken up deceit as his guide,
knows not when he can quit it. He may, indeed, say
to himself “thus far will I go, and no further,” but
when he shall have once attained the proposed limit,
and shall set himself to work to recover that straight
path from which he has once deviated, fortunate will
he be, indeed, if he find not a thousand obstacles, which
it shall tax his utmost energy, his utmost ingenuity to
surmount, if he have not to cry out in despair⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jasper St. Aubyn did honestly intend to do, the next
day, what he that night promised; nor did he doubt
that he <span class='it'>could</span> do it, and so do it, as to save her scatheless,
of whom he had not yet grown weary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, alas! of so delicate a texture is a woman’s reputation,
that the slightest doubt, the smallest shade
once cast upon it, though false as hell itself, it shall
require more than an angel’s tears to wash away the
slain. All cautiously as Jasper had contrived his visits
to the chamber of his wife, all guarded as had been
his intercourse with her, although he had never dreamed
that a suspicion had been awakened in a single mind
of the existence of such an intercourse, he had not
stolen thither once, nor returned once to his own
solitary couch, but keen, curious, prying eyes had followed
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not a maid-servant in the house but knew
Miss Theresa’s shame, as all believed it to be; but
tittered and triumphed over it in her sleeves, as an excuse,
or at least a palliation of her own peccadilloes;
but told it, in confidence, to her own lover, Tom, the
groom, or Dick, the falconer, until it was the common
gossip of the kitchen and the butlery, how the fair and
innocent Theresa was Master Jasper’s <span class='it'>mistress</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they nothing dreamed of this; and both fell asleep
that night, full of innocent hopes on the one hand, and
good determinations—alas! never to be realized, on the
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morrow came, and Sir Miles St. Aubyn was
consigned to the vault where slept his fathers of so
many generations. Among the loud and sincere lamentations
of his grateful tenantry and dependents, the
silent, heartfelt tears of Theresa, and the pale but constrained
sorrow of his son, he was committed earth to
earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, to his long last home,
by the son of the aged vicar, who had already been inducted
to the living, which his father had held so many
years before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mournful ceremonial ended, Jasper was musing
alone in the old library, considering with himself how
he might best arrange the revelation, which he proposed
to make that very evening to his household of
his hitherto concealed marriage with Theresa, when
suddenly a servant entered, and informed him that
Peter Verity, the sexton, would be glad to speak six
words with his honor, if it would not be too much
trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By no means,” replied Jasper, eagerly, for he foresaw,
as he thought, through this man a ready mode of
extricating himself from the embarrassment of the disclosure,
“admit him instantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fellow entered; a low, miserable, sneaking
scoundrel, even from his appearance; and Jasper felt
as if he almost loathed himself that he had ever had to do
with so degraded a specimen of mortality. He had
need of him, however, and was compelled, therefore,
much against his will, to greet him, and speak <a id='tohim'></a> to him
fairly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, Verity,” he said, “I am glad you have come,
I should have sent for you in the morning, if you had
not come up to-night. You have managed that affair
for me right well; and I shall not forget it, I assure
you. Here are ten guineas for you, as an earnest now,
and I shall continue your annuity, though there will be
no need for concealment any longer. Still I shall want
your assistance, and will pay you for it liberally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank your honor, kindly,” answered the fellow,
pocketing the gold. “But with regard to the annuity,
seeing as how what I’ve done for your honor is a
pretty dangerous job, and one as I fancy might touch
my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Touch your life! why what the devil does the
fellow mean!” Jasper interrupted him, starting to his
feet, “I never asked you—never asked any man—to
do aught that should affect his life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never did ask me, right out in words, that is
a fact, your honor. You was too deep for that, I’m
a thinking! But, lord bless ye, I understood ye, for
all, as well as if you <span class='it'>had</span> asked me. And so, be sure,
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
I went and did it straight. I’d ha’ done any thing to
serve your honor—that I would—and I will again,
that’s more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In God’s name, what have you done, then?” exclaimed
Jasper, utterly bewildered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, seeing as your honor didn’t wish to have
your marriage with Miss Theresa known, and as there
wasn’t no way else of hiding it, when the old parson
was dead and gone, and a new one coming, I went and
cut the record of it out of the church-register, and I’ve
got it here, safe enough. So if your honor fancies any
time to get tired like of Miss, why you can e’en take
another wife, and no one the wiser. There’s not a
soul knows aught about it but me, and black Jem
Alderly; and we’ll never say a word about it, not we.
Nor it wouldn’t matter if we did, for that, when once
you’ve got this here paper. And so I was thinking, if
your honor would just give me five hundred guineas
down, I’d hand it over, and you could just put it in the
fire, if you choosed, and no one the wiser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jasper cast his eyes up to heaven in despair, and
wrung his hands bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great God!” he said, “I would give five thousand
if you could undo this that you have done. I <span class='it'>will</span> give
you five thousand if you will replace the leaf where
it was, undiscovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ain’t possible,” replied the man. “The new
vicar he has looked over all the register, and made a
copy of it; and he keeps it locked up, too, under his
own key, so that, for my life, I could not get it, if I
would. And I’d be found out, sure as God—and it’s
hanging by the law! nothing less. But what does it
signify, if I may be so bold, your honor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When my poor father died, all cause of concealment
was at an end; and I wished this very day to
acknowledge my marriage with Mrs. St. Aubyn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man uttered a low expressive whistle, as who
should say, “Here is a change, with a vengeance!”
But he dared not express what he thought, and answered
humbly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your honor, I don’t see how this alters it.
You have nothing to do but to acknowledge madam as
your wife, and there’s no one will think of asking
when you were married, nor hasn’t no right to do so
neither. And if they should, you can say the Doctor
married you in his own parlor, and I can swear to that,
your honor; if you want me, any time; and so’ll Jem
Alderly; and this writing, that I’ll give you, will prove
it any time, for it’s in the Doctor’s own hand-writing,
and signed by the witnesses. So just you give me the
five hundred, and I’ll give you the register; and you
can do as you will with it, your honor. But if I was
your honor, and you was Peter Verity, I’d just tell
the servants, as Madam was my wife, and interduce
her as Mistress St. Aubyn like; but I’d not say when
nor where, nor nothing about it; and I’d just keep this
here paper snug; as I could perduce it, if I wanted, or
make away with it, if I wanted; it’s good to have two
strings to your bow always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jasper had listened to him in silence, with his eyes
buried in his hands, while he was speaking, and as he
ceased he made no reply; but remained motionless for
several minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he raised his head, and answered in an altered
and broken voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot be helped now, but I would give very
much it had been otherwise.” He opened a drawer,
as he spoke, in the escritoir which stood before him,
and took out of it a small box bound with brass and
secured by a massive lock, the key of which was attached
to a chain about his neck. It was filled with
rouleux of gold, from which he counted out the sum
specified, and pushed the gold across the table to the
man, saying, “Count it, and see that it is right, and
give me the paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then satisfying himself that it was the very register
in question, he folded it carefully, and put it away in
the box whence he had withdrawn the gold; while
the villain, who had tempted him stowed away the
price of his rascality in a leathern bag which he had
brought with him for the purpose, well assured that
his claim would not be denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That done, he stood erect and unblushing, and
awaited the further orders of the young Lord of
Widecomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Peter,” said he, collecting himself, “mark
me. <span class='it'>You</span> are now in my power! and, if I ever hear
that you have spoken a word without my permission,
or if you fail to speak when I command you—I will
hang you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he spoke with a devilish energy, that showed
how seriously he was in earnest. “Do you understand
that, Master Peter Verity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, your honor,” answered the man, with a
doubtful and somewhat gloomy smile; “but there is
no need of such threats with me; it is alike my interest
and my wish to serve you, as I have done already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it is my interest and my wish that you should
serve me, as differently as possible from the way in
which you have served me; or served yourself, rather,
I should say, sirrah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your honor’s pardon, if I have done wrong.
I meant to do good service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tush, sirrah! tush! If I be young, I am neither
quite a child, nor absolutely a fool. You meant to get
me into your power, and you have got yourself into
mine. Now listen to me, I know you for a very shrewd
rascal, Peter Verity, and for one who knows right well
what to say, and what not to say. Now, as I told you,
I am about this very evening to make known my marriage
with the lady whom you saw me wed. You
will be asked, doubtless, a thousand questions on the
subject by all sorts of persons. Now, mark me, you
will answer so as to let all who ask understand that I
<span class='it'>am</span> married, and that <span class='it'>you</span> have known all about it
from the first; but you will do this in such a manner
that no one shall be able to assert that <span class='it'>you</span> have asserted
any thing; and further, that, if need should be hereafter,
you may be able to deny point blank your having said
aught, or known aught on the subject. I hope you
will remember what I am desiring you to do correctly,
Peter Verity; for, of a truth, if you make the slightest
blunder, I shall carry this document, which you have
stolen from the church-register, to the nearest justice
of the peace, and make my deposition against you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand perfectly, your honor, and will do
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
your bidding correctly,” said the fellow, not a little
embarrassed at finding how much his position had altered,
since he entered the library, as he thought, well
nigh the young heir’s master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you shall do well,” replied Jasper. “Now get
you gone. Let them give you some ale in the buttery,
but when I send word to have the people collected in
the great hall, make yourself scarce. It is not desirable
that you should be there when I address them;” and
lighting a hand-lamp as he ceased speaking, for it had
grown dark already during the conversation, he turned
his back on the discomfited sexton, and went up by a
private staircase to what was called the ladies’ withdrawing
room, an apartment which, having been shut
up since the death of his own mother, had been reopened
on Theresa’s joining the family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sexton of the church has been with you,
Jasper,” she said, eagerly, as her husband entered the
room; “what should have brought him hither?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was here, you know, dearest, at the sad ceremonial;
and I had desired him to bring up a copy of the
record of our marriage. He wished to deliver it to
me in person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How good of you, dear Jasper, and how thoughtful,”
she replied, casting her fair white arms about his
neck, and kissing his forehead tenderly, “that you
may show it to the people, and prove to them that I
am indeed your wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Show</span> it to the people! <span class='it'>Prove</span> that you are my
wife!” he answered impetuously, and with indignation
in his every tone. “I should like to see the person
ask me to show it, or doubt that you are my wife.
No, indeed, dear Theresa, your very thought shows
how young you are, and ignorant of the world. To do
what you suggest, would but create the doubt, not
destroy it. No, when they have done supper, I shall
cause the whole household to be collected in the great
stone hall; and when they are there, I shall merely lead
you in upon my arm, tell them we have been married
in private these three months past, and desire them to
respect you as my dear wife, and their honored mistress.
That, and your being introduced to all friends
and visiters as Mistress St. Aubyn, is all that can be
needed; and, in cases such as ours, believe me, the
less eclat given to the circumstances, the better it will
be for all parties. And do not you, I pray you, dearest,
suffer the servant girls to ask you any questions on
the subject, or answer them if they do. But inform
me of it forthwith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would not dream of doing so, Jasper,” she
replied, gently. “And you are quite right, I am certain,
and I will do all that you wish. Oh! I am so
happy! so immeasurably happy, Jasper, even when I
should be mournful at your good father’s death, who
was so kind to me; but I cannot—I cannot—this joy
completely overwhelms me. I am too, too happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wherefore, so wondrous happy all on a sudden,
sweet one?” asked the boy, with a playful smile, laying
his hand, as he spoke, affectionately on her soft,
rounded shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I need fear no longer to let the whole world
know how dearly, how devotedly I love my husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she raised her beautiful blue eyes to his, running
over with tears of tenderness and joy; and her
sweet lips half apart, so perfumed and so rosy, and
radiant with so bright a smile, as might have tempted
the sternest anchorite to bend over her as Jasper did,
and press them with a long kiss of pure affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I will leave you, dearest,” he said, kindly,
“for a little space, while I see that things are arranged
for this great ceremonial. I will warn old Geoffry first
of what I am about to say to them, that they may not
overwhelm us by their wonder at the telling; and do
you, when you hear the great bell ring to assemble
them, put on your prettiest smile, and your most
courageous look, for then I shall be on my way to
fetch you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with a beating heart, and an almost sickening
sense of anxiety, that poor Theresa awaited the moment
which was to install her in the house of her husband
as its lawful lady. She felt the awkwardness,
the difficulty of her situation, although she was far
indeed from suspecting all the causes which in reality
existed to justify her embarrassment and timidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had not long, however, to indulge in such fancies,
and perhaps it was well that she had not; for her
timidity seemed to grow on her apace, and she began
to think that <a id='cour'></a>courage would fail her to undergo the
ordeal of eyes to which she should be exposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at this moment, when she was giving way to
her bashfulness, when her terrors were gaining complete
empire over her, the great bell began to ring.
Slow and measured the first six or seven clanging
strokes fell upon her, resembling more the minute-tolling
of a death-bell, than the gay peal that gives note of
festive tidings and rejoicing. But almost as soon as
this thought occurred to her, it seemed that the ringer,
whoever he was, had conceived the same idea, for the
cadence of the bell-ringing was changed suddenly, and
a quick, merry chime succeeded to the first solemn
clangor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same instant the door of the withdrawing-room
was thrown open, and her young husband entered
hastily, and catching her in his arms, kissed her lips
affectionately. “Come, dearest girl,” he said, as he
drew her arm through his own, “come, it will be all
over in five minutes, and then every thing will go on
as usual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And without waiting a reply, he led her down the
great staircase into the stone hall, wherein all the servants
of the household, and many of the tenantry and
neighboring yeomen, who had not yet dispersed after
the funeral, were assembled in a surprised and admiring
although silent crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old steward, to whom Jasper had communicated
his purpose, had already informed them of the object
of their convocation, and great was their wonder,
though as yet they had little time to comment on it, or
communicate their thoughts and suspicions of the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now they were all collected, quiet, indeed, and
respectful—for such was the habit of the times—but
all eagerness to hear what the young master had to say,
and, to speak truly, little impressed by the informality
of the affair, and little pleased that one whom they regarded
as little higher than themselves, should be elevated
to a rank and position so commanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
Gathering even more than his wonted share of dignity
from the solemnity of the moment, and bearing
himself even more haughtily than his wont, from
a sort of an inward consciousness that he was in
some sort descending from his proper sphere, and
lowering his wife by doing that which was yet necessary
to establish her fair fame, the young man came
down the broad oaken steps, with a slow, proud, firm
step, his athletic though slender frame seeming to expand
with the elevation of his excited feelings. He
carried his fine head, with the brows a little bent, and
his eyes, glancing like stars of fire, as they ran over
every countenance that met his gaze, seeking, as it
seemed, to find an expression which should challenge
his will or underrate his choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She clung to his arm, not timidly, although it was
evident that she felt the need of his protection, and,
although there was an air of bashfulness and a slight
tremor visible in her bearing, they were mixed with a
sort of gentle pride, the pride of conscious rectitude
and purity, and she did not cast down her beautiful
blue eyes, nor avoid the glances which were cast on
her from all sides, by some desiring to read her secret, by
some wishing to prejudge her character, but looked
around her tranquilly with a sweet lady-like self-possession,
that won many hearts to her cause, which, before
her coming, had been prepared to think of her unkindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finding no eye in the circle that met his own with
an inquisitive, much less an insolent glance, Jasper St.
Aubyn paused, and addressed his people with a subdued
and almost melancholy smile, although his voice
was clear and sonorous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a sad occasion,” he said, “on which it
first falls to my lot, my people, to address you here, as
the master of a few, the landlord of many, and, as I
hope to prove myself, the friend of all. To fill the
place of him, who has gone from us, and whom you
all knew so well, and had so much cause to love, I
never can aspire; but it is my earnest hope and desire
to live and die among you as he did; and if I fail to
gain and hold fast your affections, as he did, it shall not
be for want of endeavoring to deserve them. But my
object in calling you together, my friends, this evening,
was not merely to say this to you, or to promise you
my friendship and protection, but rather to do a duty,
which must not be deferred any longer, for my own
sake, and for that of one far dearer than myself.”
Here he paused, and pressing the little white hand
which reposed on his arm so gently, smiled in the face
of his young wife, as he moved her a little forward
into the centre of the circle. “I mean, to present to
you all, Mistress St. Aubyn, my beloved <span class='it'>wife</span>, and your
honored mistress! Some of you have been aware of
this for some time already; but to most of you it is
doubtless a surprise. Be it so. Family reasons required
that our marriage should be kept secret for a
while, those reasons are now at an end, and I am as
proud to acknowledge this dear lady as my wife, and
to claim all your homage and affection for her, both on
my account, and on account of her own virtues, as I
doubt not you will be proud and happy to have so excellent
and beautiful a lady to whom to look up as
your mistress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ceased, and three full rounds of cheering responded
to his manly speech. The circle broke up,
and crowded around the young pair, and many of the
elder tenants, white-headed men and women, came up
and craved permission to shake hands with the beautiful
young lady, and blessed her with tears in their
eyes, and wished her long life and happiness here and
hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But among the servants of the household, there
was not by any means the same feeling manifested.
The old steward, indeed, who had grown up a contemporary
of Jasper’s father, and the scarcely less
aged housekeeper, did, indeed, show some feeling, and
were probably sincere as they offered their greetings,
and promised their humble services. But among the
maid servants there passed many a meaning wink, and
half light, half sneering titter; and two or three of the
younger men nudged one another with their elbows,
and interchanged thoughts with what they considered
a vastly knowing grin. No remarks were made, however,
nor did any intimation of doubt or distrust reach
the eyes or ears of the young couple—all appeared to
be truthful mirth and honest congratulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then having ordered supper to be prepared for all
present, and liquor to be served out, both ale and wine,
of a better quality than usual, that the company might
drink the health of their young mistress, well pleased
that the embarrassing scene was at an end, Jasper led
Theresa up to her own room, palpitating with the excitement
of the scene, and agitated even by the excess
of her own happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the crowd was passing out of the hall into
the dark passages which led to the buttery and kitchen,
one of the girls of the house, a finely-shaped, buxom,
red-lipped, hazel-eyed lass, with a very roguish if not
sensual expression, hung back behind the other maids,
till she was joined by the under falconer, a strapping
fellow in a green jerkin with buckskin belt and leggins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Bess, is that you?” he said, passing his arm
round her waist, “thou’rt a good lass, to tarry for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And drawing her, nothing reluctant, aside from the
crowd into a dark corner, he kissed her a dozen times
in succession, a proceeding which she did not appear
by any means to resent, the “ha’ done nows!” to the
contrary notwithstanding, which she seemed to consider
it necessary to deliver, and which her lover,
probably correctly, understood as meaning, “pray go
on, if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This pleasant interlude completed, “Well, Bess,”
said the swain, “and what thinkst thou of the new
mistress—of the young master’s wife? She’s a rare
bit now, hant she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor, Jem!” returned the girl, laughing, “she hant
no more his wife than I be yourn, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what be she then, Bess?” said the fellow,
gaping in stupid wonderment, “thou didst hear what
Master Jasper said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why she be his sweetheart. Just what we be,
Jem,” said the unblushing girl—“what the quality
folks calls his ‘miss.’ Why, Jem, he’s slept in her
room every night since she came here. He’s only
said this here, about her being his wife, to save her
character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
“No blame to him for that, Bess, if it be so. But
if you’re wise, lass, you’ll keep this to yourself.
She’s a beauty, anyways; and I don’t fault him, if
she be his wife, or his ‘miss,’ either, for that matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor!” replied the girl. “I shan’t go to say nothing,
I’m sure. I’ve got a good place, and I mean
to keep it too. It’s naught to me how they amuse
themselves, so they don’t meddle with my sweet-hearting.
But do you think her so pretty, Jem? She’s
a poor slight little slip of a thing, seems to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She beant such an armful as thou, Bess, that’s a
fact,” answered the fellow, making a dash at her,
which she avoided, and took to her heels, looking
back, however, over her shoulders, and beckoning him
to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were not the only comments of the kind which
passed that evening; and although, fortunately for
Jasper’s and Theresa’s peace of mind, they never
dreamed of what was going on below, it was in fact
generally understood among the younger men and
women, both of those within and without the house,
that Jasper’s declaration was a mere stratagem, resorted
to in order to procure more respect and consideration
for his concubine; and, although she was
every where treated and addressed as St. Aubyn’s
wife, every succeeding day and hour she was more
generally regarded as his victim, and his mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is the consequence of a single lapse from rectitude
and truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas for Theresa! her doom, though she knew it
not, was but too surely sealed forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had it not been for the exceeding gentleness and
humility of the unhappy girl, it is probable that she
would have been very shortly made acquainted, one
way or other, with the opinion which was entertained
concerning her, in her own house, and in the neighborhood.
But the winning affability of her manners, the
total absence of all arrogance or self elevation in her
demeanor toward her inferiors in station, her respect
every where manifested to old age and virtue, her
kindness to the poor and the sick, her considerate good-nature
to her servants, and above all her liberal and
unostentatious charities, rendered it impossible that
any could be so cruel as to offer her rudeness or indignity,
on what was at most mere suspicion. Added
to this, the fierce impetuosity of Jasper, when crossed
by any thing, or opposed in his will, and the certainty
that he would stop at nothing to avenge any affront
aimed at Theresa, so long as he chose to style her his
wife, deterred not only the household and village gossips,
but even that more odious class, the hypocritical,
puritanic, self-constituted judges of society, and punishers
of what they choose to deem immorality, from following
out the bent of their mischievous or malicious
tempers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, month after month had passed
away. Winter had melted into the promises of spring;
and the gay flowers of summer had ripened into the
fruits of luxuriant autumn. A full year had run its
magic round since Theresa gave herself up to Jasper,
for better for worse, till death should them part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slender, joyous maiden had expanded into the
full-blown, thoughtful, lovely woman, who was now
watching at the oriel window, alone, at sunset for the
return of her young husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alone, ay, alone! For no child had been born to
bless their union, and to draw yet closer the indissoluble
bonds which man may not put asunder. Alone,
ay, alone! as all her days were now spent, and some,
alas! of her nights also. For the first months of her
wedded life, when the pain of concealment had been
once removed, Theresa was the happiest of the happy.
The love, the passion, the affection of her boy bridegroom
seemed to increase daily. To sit by her side,
during the snowy days of winter, to listen to her lute
struck by the master hand of the untaught improvisatrice,
to sing with her the grand old ballads which she
loved, to muse with her over the tomes of romance,
the natural vein of which was not then extinguished
in the English heart, to cull the gems of the rare dramatists
and mighty bards of the era, which was then
but expiring; and, when the early days of spring-time
gave token of their coming, in the swelling flower-bud
and bursting leaf, to wander with her through the park,
through the chase, to ride with her over the heathery
moorland hills, and explore the wild recesses of the
forest, to have her near him in his field-sports, to show
her how he struck the silvery salmon, or roused the
otter from his sedgy lair—these seemed to be the only
joys the boy coveted—her company his chiefest pleasure,
the undisturbed possession of her charms his
crowning bliss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But passion is proverbially short-lived; and the most
so with those who, like Jasper, have no solidity of
character, no stability of feeling, no fixed principles,
whereon to fall back for support. One of the great
defects of Jasper’s nature was a total lack of reverence
for any thing divine or human—he had loved many
things, he never had respected one. Accustomed from
his earliest boyhood to see every thing yield to his
will, to measure the value of every thing by the present
pleasure it afforded him; he expected to receive
all things, yet to give nothing. He was in fact a very
pattern of pure selfishness, though no one would have
been so much amazed as he had he heard himself so
named.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed, and he grew weary, even of the very
excess of his happiness—even of the amiability, the
sweetness, the ever-yielding gentleness of his Theresa.
That she should so long have charmed one so rash
and reckless was the real wonder, not that she should
now have lost the power of charming him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless so it was; the mind of Jasper was not
so constituted as to rest very long content with any
thing, least of all with tranquillity⁠—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>For quiet to hot bosoms is a hell!</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and his, surely, was of the hottest. He began as of
old to long for excitement; and even the pleasures of
the chase, to which he was still devoted, began to
prove insufficient to gratify his wild and eager spirit.
Day after day, Theresa saw less of him, and ere long
knew not how or where many of his days were spent.
Confidence, in the true sense of the word, there never
had been between them; respect or esteem, founded
upon her real virtues and rare excellences, he had
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
never felt—therefore, when the heat and fierceness of
passion died out, as it were, by the consumption of its
own fuel, when her personal charms palled on him by
possession, when her intellectual endowments wearied
him, because they were in truth far beyond the range
of his comprehension, and therefore out of the pale of
his sympathies, he had nothing left whereon to build
affection—thus passion once dead in his heart, all was
gone at once which had bound him to Theresa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He neglected her, he left her alone—alone, without
a companion, a friend, in the wide world. Still she
complained not, wept not, above all, upbraided not.
She sought to occupy herself, to amuse her solitude
with her books, her music, her wild flights into the
world of fancy. And when he did come home from
his fierce, frantic gallops across the country with the
worst and wildest of the young yeomanry, from his
disgraceful orgies with the half gentry of the nearest
market-town, she received him ever with kindness,
gentleness and love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She never let him know that she wept in silence;
never allowed him to see that she noticed his altered
manner; but smiled on him, and <a id='sang'></a>sang to him, and
fondled him, as if he had been to her—and was he not
so?—all that she had on earth. And he, such is the
spirit of the selfish and the reckless of our sex, almost
began to hate her, for the very meekness and affection
with which she submitted to his unkindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt that her unchanged, unreproaching love was
the keenest reproach to his altered manner, to his
neglectful coldness. He felt that he could better have
endured the bitterest blame, the most agonized remonstrance,
the tears of the veriest Niobe, than meet the
ever welcoming smile of those rosy lips, the ever
loving glance of those soft blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps had she possessed more of what such men
as he call spirit, had the vein of her genius led to outbursts
of vehement, unfeminine, Italian passion, the
flashing eye, the curling lip, the face pallid with rage,
the tongue fluent with the torrent eloquence of indignation,
he might have found in them something to
rouse his dormant passions from the lethargy which
had overcome them, something to stimulate and excite
him into renewed desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as well might you expect from the lily of the
valley the blushes and the thorns of the rose, from the
turtle-dove the fury and the flight of the jer-falcon, as
aught from Theresa St. Aubyn, but the patience, the
purity, the quiet, and the love of a white-minded, virtuous
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was wretched—most wretched—because
hopeless. She had prayed for a child, with all the
yearning eagerness of disappointed craving womanhood—a
child that should smile in her face, and love
her for herself, being of herself, and her own—a child
that should perhaps win back to her the lost affections
of her lord. But in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still she loved him, nay, adored him, as of old.
Never did she see his stately form, sitting his horse
with habitual grace, approaching listlessly and slowly
the home which no longer had a single attraction to
his jaded and exhausted heart, but her whole frame
was shaken by a sharp nervous tremor, but a mist
overspread her swimming eyes, but dull ringing filled
her ears, her heart throbbed and palpitated, until she
thought it would burst forth from her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ever hoped that the cold spell might pass from
him, ever believed, ever trusted, that the time would
come when he would again love her as of old, again
seek her society, and take pleasure in her conversation;
again let her nestle in his bosom, and look up into his
answering eyes, by the quiet fireside in winter evenings.
Alas! she still dreamed of these things—even
although her reason told her that they were hopeless—even
after he had again changed his mood from sullen
coldness to harsh, irritable anger, to vehement, impetuous,
fiery wrath, causeless as the wolf’s against
the lamb, and <span class='it'>therefore</span> the more deadly and unsparing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Politics had run high in the land of late, and every
where parties were forming. Since the battle of
Sedgemoor, and the merciless cruelty with which the
royal judges had crushed out the life of that abortive
insurrection, and drowned its ashes in floods of innocent
gore, the rage of factions had waxed wilder in
the country than they had done since the reign of the
first Charles, the second English king of that unhappy
race, the last of whom now filled the painful seat of
royalty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet all was hushed as yet and quiet, as the calm
which precedes the bursting of a thunder-cloud. Secluded
as Widecomb Manor was, and far divided from
the seats of the other gentry of Devonshire by tracts
of moor and forest, and little intercourse as Jasper
had held hitherto with his equals in rank and birth—limited
as that intercourse had been to a few visits
of form, and a few annual banquets—the stir of the
political world reached even the remote House in the
Woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mad whirl of politics was precisely the thing
to captivate a mind such as Jasper’s; and the instant
the subject was broached to him, by some of the more
leading youths of the county, he plunged headlong into
its deepest vortices, and was soon steeped to the lips
in conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Events rendered it necessary that he should visit the
metropolis, and twice during the autumn he had already
visited it—alone. And twice he had returned to his
beautiful young wife, who hailed his coming as a
heathen priestess would have greeted the advent of
her god, more alienated, colder, and more causeless
than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since he had last returned, the coldness was converted
into cruelty, active, malicious, fiendish cruelty.
Hard words, incessant taunts, curses—nay, blows!
Yet still, faithful to the end and fond, she still loved
him. Still would have laid down the dregs of the
life which had been so happy till she knew him, and
which he had made so wretched, to win one of his old
fond smiles, one of his once caressing tones, one of his
heartfelt kisses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! alas! Theresa! Too late, it was all too late!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had learned, for the first time, in London, the
value of his rank, his wealth, his position. He had
been flattered by men of lordly birth, <span class='it'>fêted</span> and fondled
by the fairest and noblest ladies of the land. He had
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
learned to be ambitious—he had begun to thirst for
social eminence, for political ascendency, for place,
power, dominion. His talents had created a favorable
impression in high quarters—his enthusiasm and daring
rashness had made an effect—he was already a marked
man among the conspirators, who were aiming to pull
down the sovereignty of the Stuarts. Hints had been
even thrown out to him, of the possibility of allying
himself to interests the most important, through the
beautiful and gorgeous daughter of one of the oldest of
the peers of England. The hint had been thrown out,
moreover, by a young gentleman of his own county—by
one who had seen Theresa. And when he started
and expressed his wonder, and alluded tremulously to
his <span class='it'>wife</span>, he had been answered by a smile of intelligence,
coupled with an assurance that every one understood
all about Theresa Allan; and that surely he
would not be such a fool as to sacrifice such prospects
for a little village paramour. “The story of the concealed
wedding took in nobody, my lad,” the speaker
added, “except those, like myself, who chose to believe
any thing you chose to assert. Think of it, <span class='it'>mon
cher</span>; and, believe me, that <span class='it'>liaison</span> will be no hindrance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Jasper had thought of it. The thought had
never been, for one moment, absent from his mind,
sleeping or waking, since it first found admission to
the busy chambers of his brain. From that unfortunate
day, his life had been but one series of plots and
schemes, all base, atrocious, horrible—some even
murderous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since that day his cruelty had not been casual; it
had a meaning, and a method, both worthy of the arch
fiend’s devising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sought first deliberately to break her heart, to
kill her without violence, by the action of her own
outraged affections—and then, when that failed, or
rather when he saw that the process must needs be
too slow to meet his accursed views, he aimed at
driving her to commit suicide—thus slaying, should he
succeed in his hellish scheme, body and soul together
of the woman whom he had sworn before God’s holy
altar, with the most solemn adjuration, to love, comfort,
honor, and keep in sickness and in health—the
woman whose whole heart and soul were his absolute
possession; who had never formed a wish, or entertained
a thought, but to love him and to make him
happy. And this—this was her reward. Could she,
indeed, have fully conceived the extent of the feelings
which he now entertained toward her, could she have
believed that he really was desirous of her death, was
actually plotting how he might bring it about, without
dipping his hand in her blood, or calling down the
guilt of downright murder on his soul, I believe he
would have been spared all further wickedness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To have known that he felt toward her not merely
casual irritation, that his conduct was not the effect of
a bad disposition, or of an evil temper only, but that
determined hatred had supplanted the last spark of
love in his soul, and that he was possessed by a resolution
to rid himself of the restraint which his marriage
had brought upon him, by one means or another—to
have known this, I say, would have so frozen her
young blood, would have so stricken her to the heart,
that, if it had not slain her outright, it would have left
her surely—perhaps happier even to be such—a maniac
for the poor remnant of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That morning, at an early hour, he had ridden forth,
with two or three dogs at his heel, and the game-keeper,
James Alderly, better known in that neighborhood
as Black Jem, who had of late been his constant
companion, following him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner-time had passed—supper-time—yet he came
not; and the deserted creature was yet watching wistfully,
hopefully for his return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, far off among the stems of the distant
trees, she caught a glimpse of a moving object; it approached;
it grew more distinct—it was he, returning
at a gallop, as he seldom now returned to his distasteful
home, with his dogs careering merrily along by his
side, and the grim-visaged keeper spurring in vain to
keep up with the furious speed at which he rode, far
in the rear of his master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pressed her hand upon her heart, and drew a
long, deep breath. “Once more,” she murmured to
herself, “he hath come back to me once more!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then the hope flashed upon her mind that the
changed pace at which he rode, and something which
even at that distance she could descry in his air and
mien, might indicate an alteration in his feelings.
“Yes, yes! Great God! can it be? He sees me, he
waves his hand to me. He loves—he loves me once
again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with a mighty effort she choked down the
paroxysm of joy, which had almost burst out in a flood
of tears, and hurried from the room, and out upon the
terrace, to meet him, to receive once more a smile of
greeting. His dogs came bounding up to her, as she
stood at the top of the stone steps, and fawned upon
her, for they loved her—every thing loved her, save
he only who had most cause to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet now, it was true, he did smile upon her, as he
dismounted from his horse, and called her once more
“Dear Theresa.” And he passed his arm about her
slender waist, and led her back into the house, chiding
her good-humoredly for exposing herself to the chilly
night-wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel it not,” she said, joyously, with her own
sunny smile lighting up her face, “I feel it not—nor
should feel it, were it charged with all the snow storms
of the north; my heart is so warm, so full. Oh!
Jasper, that dear name, in your own voice, has made
me but too happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly child!” he replied, “silly child,” patting her
affectionately on the shoulder, as he had used to do in
times long past—at least it seemed long, very long to
her, though they were in truth but a few months distant.
“And do you love me, Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love you?” she said, gazing up into his eyes with
more of wonder that he should ask such a question,
than of any other feeling. “Love you, oh, God! can
you doubt it, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, hesitating slightly, “no, dearest.
And yet I have given you but little cause of late to
love me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know <span class='it'>that</span>—do you feel <span class='it'>that</span>, Jasper?” she
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
cried, eagerly, joyously, “then I am, indeed, happy;
then you really do love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can you forgive me, Theresa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive you—for what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the pain I have caused you of late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all gone—it is all forgotten! You have been
vexed, grieved about something that has wrung you in
secret. But you should have told me of it, dearest
Jasper, and I would have consoled you. But it is all,
all over now; nay, but I am now glad of it, since this
great joy is all the sweeter for the past sorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you love me well enough, Theresa, to
make a sacrifice, a great sacrifice for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To sacrifice my heart’s blood—ay, my life, if to do
so would make you happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your life, silly wench! how should your little
life profit me? But that is the way ever with you women.
If one ask you the smallest trifle, you ever
proffer your lives, as if they could be of any use, or as
if one would not be hanged for taking them. I have
known girls refuse one kiss, and then make a tender of
their lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with something of his late habitual bitterness,
it is true; but there was a smile on his face, as
he uttered the words, and she laughed merrily, as she
answered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I will not refuse you fifty of those; I will be
only too glad if you think them worth the taking. But
I did speak foolishly, dearest; and you must not blame
me for it, for my heart is so overflowing with joy, that,
of a truths I scarcely know what I say. I only wished
to express that there is nothing in the wide world
which you can ask of me, that I will not do, willingly,
gladly. Will that satisfy you, Jasper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, ay! if you hold to it, Theresa,” he answered,
eagerly; “but, mind you, it is really a sacrifice
which I ask—a great sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No sacrifice is great,” she replied, pressing his
arm, on which she was hanging with both her white
hands linked together over it, “no sacrifice which I
can make, so long as <span class='it'>you</span> love me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>do</span> love you, dearly, girl,” he answered; “and
if you do this that I would have you do, I will love
you ten times better than I do, ten times better than I
ever did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That were a bribe indeed,” she replied, laughing
with her own silvery, girlish laugh. “But I don’t believe
you could love me ten times better than you once
did, Jasper. But if you will promise me to love me
ever as you did then, you may ask me any thing under
heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I will promise—I will promise, wench. See
that you be as ready to perform.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, as he spoke, he stooped down, for the keeper
had now retired with the horses, and they were entirely
alone, and embraced her closely, and kissed her
as he had not done for many a month before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will—I will, indeed, dear, dearest Jasper. Tell
me, what is it I must do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to your room, dearest, and I will join you there
and tell you. I must get me a crust of bread and a
goblet of wine, and give some directions to the men,
and then I will join you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be very long, dearest. I am dying to know
what I can do to please you.” And she stood upon tiptoes,
and kissed his brow playfully, and then ran up
stairs with a lighter step than had borne her for many
a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her husband gazed after her with a grim smile, and
nodded his head in self-approbation. “This is the
better way, after all. But will she, will she stand to
it? I should not be surprised. ’S death! one can never
learn these women! What d—d fools they are, when
all is told! Flattery, flattery and falsehood, lay it on
thick enough, will win the best of them from heaven
to—Hades!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, man, man! and all that was but acting.</p>

<p class='line0'>“A friend!” Are you a friend? No, by my soul!</p>
<p class='line0'>Since you dare breathe the shadow of a doubt</p>
<p class='line0'>That I am true as Truth: since you give not</p>
<p class='line0'>Unto my briefest look—my gayest word⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>My faintest change of cheek—my softest touch⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Most sportive, careless smile, or low-breathed sigh⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Nay, to my voice’s lightest modulation,</p>
<p class='line0'>Though imperceptible to all but you,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>If you give not to these, unquestioning,</p>
<p class='line0'>A limitless faith—the faith you give to Heaven⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>I will not call you “friend.” I would disdain</p>
<p class='line0'>A seraph’s heart, as yours I now renounce,</p>
<p class='line0'>If such the terms on which ’twere proffered me.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Deny me Faith—that poor, yet priceless boon⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>And you deny the very soul of love.</p>
<p class='line0'>As well withhold the lamp, whose light reveals</p>
<p class='line0'>The sculptured beauty latent in its urn,</p>
<p class='line0'>As proffer Friendship’s diamond <span class='it'>in the dark</span>.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;What though a thousand seeming proofs condemn me?</p>
<p class='line0'>If my calm image smile not clear through all,</p>
<p class='line0'>Serene, and without shadow on your heart⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Nay, if the very vapors that would veil it,</p>
<p class='line0'>Part not, illumined by its presence pure,</p>
<p class='line0'>As round Night’s tranquil queen the clouds divide,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then rend it from that heart! I ask no place,</p>
<p class='line0'>Though ’twere a throne, without the state becomes me⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Without the homage due to royal Truth.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And should a world betide pronounce me false,</p>
<p class='line0'>You are to choose between the world and me.</p>
<p class='line0'>If <span class='it'>I</span> be not more than <span class='it'>all</span> worlds to you,</p>
<p class='line0'>I will not stoop to <span class='it'>less</span>! I will have <span class='it'>all</span>⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Your proudest, purest, noblest, loftiest love⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Your perfect trust—your soul of soul—or nothing!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Shall I <span class='it'>not</span> have them? Speak! on poorer spirits⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Who are content with less, because, forsooth,</p>
<p class='line0'>The whole would blind or blight them, or because</p>
<p class='line0'>They have but less to give—will you <span class='it'>divide</span></p>
<p class='line0'>The glory of your own? or concentrate</p>
<p class='line0'>On mine its radiant life?—on mine! that holds</p>
<p class='line0'>As yet, in calm reserve, the boundless wealth</p>
<p class='line0'>Of tenderness its Maker taught to it.</p>
<p class='line0'>Speak! shall we part, and go our separate ways,</p>
<p class='line0'>Each with a half life in a burning soul,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like two wild clouds, whose meeting would evoke</p>
<p class='line0'>The electric flame pent up within their bosoms,</p>
<p class='line0'>That, parted, weep their fiery hearts away,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or waste afar—and darken into death?</p>
<p class='line0'>Speak! do we part? or are we <span class='it'>one</span> forever?</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Since I must love thee—since a weird wild fate</p>
<p class='line0'>Impels me to thy heart against my will⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Do thou this justice to the heart I yield:</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Be its ideal</span>. Let it not blush to love.</p>
<p class='line0'>Bid it not trail its light and glorious wings</p>
<p class='line0'>Through the dull dust of earth, with downcast eyes</p>
<p class='line0'>And drooping brow, where Shame and Grief usurp</p>
<p class='line0'>Calm Honor’s throne!—be noble, truthful, brave;</p>
<p class='line0'>Love Honor more than Love, and more than me;</p>
<p class='line0'>Be all thou wert ere the world came between</p>
<p class='line0'>Thee and thy God.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hear’st thou my spirit pleading</p>
<p class='line0'>With suppliant, claspéd hands to thine, dear love?</p>
<p class='line0'>Degrade her not, but let thy stronger soul</p>
<p class='line0'>Soar with her to the seraph’s realm of light.</p>
<p class='line0'>She yields to thee; do with her as thou wilt.</p>
<p class='line0'>She shuts her wings in utter weariness,</p>
<p class='line0'>For she has wandered all night long astray,</p>
<p class='line0'>And found no rest—no fountain of sweet love,</p>
<p class='line0'>Save such as mocked her with a maddening thirst.</p>
<p class='line0'>She asks of thine repose, protection, peace;</p>
<p class='line0'>Implores thee with wild tears and passionate prayers</p>
<p class='line0'>To give her shelter through the night of Time,</p>
<p class='line0'>And lead her home at morn; for long ago</p>
<p class='line0'>She lost her way.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Ah! thou may’st give, instead</p>
<p class='line0'>Of that sweet boon she asks, if so thou wilt,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wild suffering, madness, shame, self-scorn, despair!</p>
<p class='line0'>But thou wilt not! thine eyes—thy glorious eyes⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Are eloquent with generous love and faith,</p>
<p class='line0'>And through thy voice a mighty heart intones</p>
<p class='line0'>Its rich vibrations, while thou murmurest low</p>
<p class='line0'>All lovely promises, and precious dreams</p>
<p class='line0'>For the sweet Future. So, I trust thee, love,</p>
<p class='line0'>And place my hand in thine, for good or ill.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;——</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Do not my soul that wrong! translate not thus</p>
<p class='line0'>The spirit-words my eyes are saying to thee:</p>
<p class='line0'>I would not fetter that rich heart of thine,</p>
<p class='line0'>Save by the perfect liberty I give it,</p>
<p class='line0'>For all God’s worlds of glory. Go thou forth⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Be free as air! Love all the good and pure;</p>
<p class='line0'>Cherish all love that can ennoble thee;</p>
<p class='line0'>Unfold thy soul to all sweet ministries,</p>
<p class='line0'>That it may grow toward heaven, as a flower</p>
<p class='line0'>Drinks dew and light, and pays them back in beauty.</p>
<p class='line0'>And if—ah heaven! these tears are love’s, not grief’s⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>And if some higher ministry than mine,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or some more genial nature, bless thee more,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wrong not thyself, or me, or love, or truth,</p>
<p class='line0'>By shrinking weakly from thy destiny.</p>
<p class='line0'>I would not owe to pitying tenderness</p>
<p class='line0'>The joy with which thy presence lights my life.</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou shalt still love all that is thine, dear friend,</p>
<p class='line0'>In my true soul—all that is right and great;</p>
<p class='line0'>And that I still love thee, so proudly, purely⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>That shall be joy enough! Go calmly forth.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;——</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Would I were any thing that thou dost love⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A flower, a shell, a wavelet, or a cloud⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Aught that might win a moment’s soul-look from thee.</p>
<p class='line0'>To be “a joy forever” in thy heart,</p>
<p class='line0'>That were in truth divinest joy to mine:</p>
<p class='line0'>A low, sweet, haunting Tune, that will not let</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy memory go, but fondly twines around it,</p>
<p class='line0'>Pleading and beautiful—for unto thee</p>
<p class='line0'>Music is life—such life as I would be;</p>
<p class='line0'>A Statue, wrought in marble, without stain,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where one immortal truth embodied lives</p>
<p class='line0'>Instinct with grace and loveliness; a Fane,</p>
<p class='line0'>A fair Ionic temple, growing up,</p>
<p class='line0'>Light as a lily into the blue air,</p>
<p class='line0'>To the glad melody of a tuneful thought</p>
<p class='line0'>In its creator’s spirit, where thy gaze</p>
<p class='line0'>Might never weary—dedicate to thee,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy image shrined within it, lone and loved;</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Make</span> me the Flower thou lovest; let me drink</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy rays, and give them back in bloom and beauty;</p>
<p class='line0'>Mould me to grace, to glory, like the Statue;</p>
<p class='line0'>Wake for my mind the Music of thine own,</p>
<p class='line0'>And it shall grow, to that majestic tune,</p>
<p class='line0'>A temple meet to shrine mine idol in;</p>
<p class='line0'>Hold the frail shell, tinted by love’s pure blush,</p>
<p class='line0'>Unto thy <span class='it'>soul</span>, and thou shalt hear within</p>
<p class='line0'>Tones from its spirit-home; smile on the wave,</p>
<p class='line0'>And it shall flow, free, limpid, glad, forever;</p>
<p class='line0'>Shed on the cloud the splendor of thy being,</p>
<p class='line0'>And it shall float—a radiant wonder—by thee!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To love—<span class='it'>thy</span> love—so docile I would be,</p>
<p class='line0'>So pliant, yet inspired, that it should make</p>
<p class='line0'>A marvel of me, for thy sake, and show</p>
<p class='line0'>Its proud <span class='it'>chef d’œuvre</span> in my harmonious life.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;——</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I would be judged by that great heart of thine,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wherein a voice more genuine, more divine</p>
<p class='line0'>Than world-taught Reason, fondly speaks for me,</p>
<p class='line0'>And bids thee love and trust, through cloud and shine,</p>
<p class='line0'>The frail and fragile creature who would be</p>
<p class='line0'>Naught here—hereafter—if not <span class='it'>all</span> to thee!</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou call’st me changeful as the summer cloud,</p>
<p class='line0'>And wayward as a wave, and light as air.</p>
<p class='line0'>And I am all thou sayest—all, and worse;</p>
<p class='line0'>But the wild cloud can weep, as well as lighten,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the wave mirrors heaven, as my soul thee;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the light air, that frolicks without thought</p>
<p class='line0'>O’er yonder harp, makes music as it goes.</p>
<p class='line0'>Let <span class='it'>me</span> play on the soul-harp I love best,</p>
<p class='line0'>And teach it all its dreaming melody;</p>
<p class='line0'>That is my mission; I have nothing else,</p>
<p class='line0'>In all the world, to do. And I shall go</p>
<p class='line0'>Musicless, aimless, idle, through all life,</p>
<p class='line0'>Unless I play my part there—only there.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In the full anthem which the universe</p>
<p class='line0'>Intones to heaven, my heart will have no share,</p>
<p class='line0'>Unless I have that soul-harp to myself,</p>
<p class='line0'>And wake it to what melody I please.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;——</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;So wrote the Lady Imogen—the child</p>
<p class='line0'>Of Poetry and Passion—all her frame</p>
<p class='line0'>So lightly, exquisitely shaped, we dreamed</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas fashioned to the echo of some song⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The fairest, airiest creature ever made⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Flower-like in her fragility and grace,</p>
<p class='line0'>Childlike in sweet impetuous tenderness,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet with a nature proud, profound, and pure,</p>
<p class='line0'>As a rapt sybil’s. O’er her soul had passed</p>
<p class='line0'>The wild simoom of wo, but to awake</p>
<p class='line0'>From that Eolian lyre the loveliest tones</p>
<p class='line0'>Of mournful music, passionately sad.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Not thus her love the haughty Ida breathed:</p>
<p class='line0'>In her ideal beauty calm and high,</p>
<p class='line0'>O’er the patrician paleness of her cheek,</p>
<p class='line0'>Came, seldom, and how softly! the faint blush</p>
<p class='line0'>Of irrepressible tenderness.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;——</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Your course has been a conqueror’s through life;</p>
<p class='line0'>You have been followed, flattered and caressed;</p>
<p class='line0'>Soul after soul has laid upon your shrine</p>
<p class='line0'>Its first, fresh, dewy bloom of love for incense:</p>
<p class='line0'>The minstrel-girl has tuned for you her lute,</p>
<p class='line0'>And set her life to music for your sake;</p>
<p class='line0'>The opera-belle, with blush unwonted, starts</p>
<p class='line0'>At your name’s casual mention, and forgets,</p>
<p class='line0'>For one strange moment, fashion’s cold repose;</p>
<p class='line0'>The village maiden’s conscious heart beats time</p>
<p class='line0'>To your entrancing melody of verse,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, from that hour, of your belovéd image</p>
<p class='line0'>Makes a life-idol. And you know it all,</p>
<p class='line0'>And smile, half-pleased, and half in scorn, to know.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But you have never known, nor shall you now,</p>
<p class='line0'>Who, ’mid the throng you sometimes meet, receives</p>
<p class='line0'>Your careless recognition with a thrill,</p>
<p class='line0'>At her adoring heart, worth all that homage!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;You see not, ’neath her half-disdainful smile,</p>
<p class='line0'>The passionate tears it is put on to hide;</p>
<p class='line0'>You dream not what a wild sigh dies away</p>
<p class='line0'>In her laugh’s joyous trill; you cannot guess⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>You, who see only with your outer sense,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A warped, chilled sense, that wrongs you every hour⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>You cannot guess, when her cold hand you take,</p>
<p class='line0'>That <span class='it'>a soul</span> trembles in that light, calm clasp!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;You speak to her, with your world tone; ah, not</p>
<p class='line0'>With the home cadence of confiding love!</p>
<p class='line0'>And she replies: a few, low, formal words</p>
<p class='line0'>Are all she dares, nay deigns, return; and so</p>
<p class='line0'>You part, for months, again. Yet in that brief,</p>
<p class='line0'>Oasis hour of her desert life,</p>
<p class='line0'>She has quaffed eagerly the enchanted spring,</p>
<p class='line0'>The sun-lit wave of thought in your rich mind;</p>
<p class='line0'>And passes on her weary pilgrimage</p>
<p class='line0'>Refreshed, and with a renovated strength.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And this has been for years. She was a child⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A school-girl—when the echo of your lyre</p>
<p class='line0'>First came to her, with music on its wings,</p>
<p class='line0'>And her soul drank from it the life of life.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Then, in a festive scene, you claimed her hand</p>
<p class='line0'>For the gay dance, and, in its intervals,</p>
<p class='line0'>Spoke soothingly and gently, for you saw</p>
<p class='line0'>Her timid blush, but did not dream its cause.</p>
<p class='line0'>Even then her young heart worshiped you, and shrunk,</p>
<p class='line0'>With a vague sense of fear and shame, away.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;She who, with others, was, and is, even now,</p>
<p class='line0'>Light, fearless, joyous, buoyant as a bird,</p>
<p class='line0'>That lets the air-swung spray beneath it bend,</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor cares, so it may carol, what shall chance,</p>
<p class='line0'>With <span class='it'>you</span>, forgets her song, foregoes her mirth,</p>
<p class='line0'>And hushes all her music in her heart.</p>
<p class='line0'>It is because your soul, that should know hers</p>
<p class='line0'>With an intuitive tenderness, is blind!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But once again you met; then, years went by,</p>
<p class='line0'>And in a thronged, luxurious saloon,</p>
<p class='line0'>You drew her fluttering hand within your arm;</p>
<p class='line0'>A few blest moments next your heart it lay;</p>
<p class='line0'>And still the lady mutely veiled, from yours,</p>
<p class='line0'>Eyes where her glorious secret wildly shone;</p>
<p class='line0'>And you, a-weary of her seeming dullness,</p>
<p class='line0'>Grew colder day by day. But <span class='it'>once</span> you paused</p>
<p class='line0'>Beside her seat, and murmured words of praise.</p>
<p class='line0'>Praise from <span class='it'>your</span> lips! My God! the ecstasy</p>
<p class='line0'>Of that dear moment! Each bright word, embalmed</p>
<p class='line0'>In Memory’s tears of amber, gleams there yet⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The costliest beads in her rich rosary.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But you were blind! And after that a cloud,</p>
<p class='line0'>Colder and darker, hung between her heart</p>
<p class='line0'>And yours. There were malicious, lovely lips,</p>
<p class='line0'>That knew too well the poison of a hint,</p>
<p class='line0'>And it worked deep and sure. And years, again,</p>
<p class='line0'>Stole by, and now once more we meet. <span class='it'>We meet?</span> ah, no;</p>
<p class='line0'>We ne’er have met! Hand may touch hand, perchance,</p>
<p class='line0'>And eye glance back to eye its idle smile;</p>
<p class='line0'>But our <span class='it'>souls</span> meet not: for, from boyhood, you</p>
<p class='line0'>Have been a mad idolater of beauty.</p>
<p class='line0'>And <span class='it'>I</span>! ah, Heaven! had you returned my love,</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>I</span> had been beautiful in your dear eyes;</p>
<p class='line0'>For love and joy and hope within the spirit</p>
<p class='line0'>Make luminous the face. But let that pass:</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span></p>
<p class='line0'>I murmur not. In <span class='it'>my</span> soul Pride is crowned</p>
<p class='line0'>And throned—a queen; and at her feet lies Love,</p>
<p class='line0'>Her <span class='it'>slave</span>—in chains—<span class='it'>that you shall ne’er unclasp</span>.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Yet, oh! if aspirations, ever rising,</p>
<p class='line0'>With an intense idolatry of love,</p>
<p class='line0'>Toward all of grace and parity and truth</p>
<p class='line0'>That we may dream, can shape the soul to beauty,</p>
<p class='line0'>(As I believe,) then, in that better world,</p>
<p class='line0'>You will not ask if I were fair on earth.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;You have loved often—passionately, perchance⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Never</span> with that wild, rapturous, poet-love</p>
<p class='line0'>Which <span class='it'>I</span> might win—and <span class='it'>will</span>. Not here on earth:</p>
<p class='line0'>I would not have the ignoble, trivial cares</p>
<p class='line0'>Of common life come o’er our glorious union,</p>
<p class='line0'>To mar its spirit-beauty. In His home</p>
<p class='line0'>We shall meet calmly, gracefully, without</p>
<p class='line0'>Alloy of petty ills.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Meantime, I read you, as no other reads;</p>
<p class='line0'>I read your soul—its burning, baffled hopes;</p>
<p class='line0'>Its proud, pure aims, whose wings are melted off</p>
<p class='line0'>In the warm sunshine of the world’s applause;</p>
<p class='line0'>Its yearning for an <span class='it'>angel’s</span> tenderness:</p>
<p class='line0'>I read it all, and grieve, and sometimes blush,</p>
<p class='line0'>That you can desecrate so grand a shrine</p>
<p class='line0'>By the false gods you place there! <span class='it'>you</span>, who know</p>
<p class='line0'>The lore of love so perfectly, who trace</p>
<p class='line0'>The delicate labyrinth of a woman’s heart,</p>
<p class='line0'>With a sure clew, so true, so fine, so rare,</p>
<p class='line0'>Some angel Ariadne gave it you!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;If I knew how to stoop, I’d tell you more:</p>
<p class='line0'>I’d win your love, even now, by a slight word;</p>
<p class='line0'>But that I’ll say in heaven. Till we meet there,</p>
<p class='line0'>Unto God’s love I leave you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line0'>You will glance round among the crowd hereafter,</p>
<p class='line0'>And dream my woman’s heart must sure betray me.</p>
<p class='line0'>Not so: I have not schooled, for weary years,</p>
<p class='line0'>Eye, lip, and cheek, and voice, to be shamed now</p>
<p class='line0'>By your bold gaze. Ah! were I <span class='it'>not</span> secure</p>
<p class='line0'>In my pride’s sanctuary, this revelation</p>
<p class='line0'>Were an act, Heaven, nor you, could ever pardon;</p>
<p class='line0'>And still less <span class='it'>I</span>. Nor would I now forego,</p>
<p class='line0'>Even for your love, the deep, divine delight</p>
<p class='line0'>Of this most pure and unsuspected passion,</p>
<p class='line0'>That none have guessed, or will, while I have life.</p>
<p class='line0'>You smile, perchance. Beware! I shall shame <span class='it'>you</span>,</p>
<p class='line0'>If with suspicion’s plummet you dare sound</p>
<p class='line0'>The unfathomed deeps of feeling in this heart.</p>
<p class='line0'>It shall bring up, ’stead of that love it seeks,</p>
<p class='line0'>A scorn you look not for. Ay, I would die</p>
<p class='line0'>A martyr’s death, sir, rather than betray</p>
<p class='line0'>To you by faintest flatter of a pulse⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>By lightest change of cheek or eyelid’s fall⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>That <span class='it'>I</span> am she who loves, adores, and flies you!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Ask why the holy starlight, or the blush</p>
<p class='line0'>Of summer blossoms, or the balm that floats</p>
<p class='line0'>From yonder lily like an angel’s breath,</p>
<p class='line0'>Is lavished on such men! God gives them all</p>
<p class='line0'>For some high end; and thus, the seeming waste</p>
<p class='line0'>Of her rich soul—its starlight purity,</p>
<p class='line0'>Its every feeling delicate as a flower,</p>
<p class='line0'>Its tender trust, its generous confidence,</p>
<p class='line0'>Its wondering disdain of littleness⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>These, by the coarser sense of those around her</p>
<p class='line0'>Uncomprehended, may not all be vain,</p>
<p class='line0'>But win them—they unwitting of the spell⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>By ties unfelt, to nobler, loftier life.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And they dare blame her! they whose every thought,</p>
<p class='line0'>Look, utterance, act, has more of evil in ’t,</p>
<p class='line0'>Than e’er she dreamed of, or could understand!</p>
<p class='line0'>And she must blush before them, with a heart</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose lightest throb is worth their all of life!⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>They boast their charity: oh, idle boast!</p>
<p class='line0'>They give the poor, forsooth, food, fuel, shelter!</p>
<p class='line0'>Faint, chilled and worn, her soul implored a pittance⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Her <span class='it'>soul asked alms</span> of theirs—and was denied!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;It was not much it came a-begging for:</p>
<p class='line0'>A simple boon, only a gentle thought,</p>
<p class='line0'>A kindly judgment of such deeds of hers</p>
<p class='line0'>As passed their understanding, but to her</p>
<p class='line0'>Seemed natural as the blooming of a flower:</p>
<p class='line0'>For God taught her—but they had learned of men</p>
<p class='line0'>The meagre doling of their measured love,</p>
<p class='line0'>A selfish, sensual love, most unlike hers.</p>
<p class='line0'>God taught the tendril where to cling, and she</p>
<p class='line0'>Learned the same lovely lesson, with the same</p>
<p class='line0'>Unquestioning and pliant trust in Him.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And yet that He should let a lyre of heaven</p>
<p class='line0'>Be played on by such hands, with touch so rude,</p>
<p class='line0'>Might wake a doubt in less than perfect faith,</p>
<p class='line0'>Perfect as mine, in his beneficence.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>What droll scenes hobgoblins and sprites catch a
peep at, in their perambulations through this ludicrous
world of ours!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we, poor mortals, rarely stumble upon any thing
funny, because, forsooth, we must ring the bell, or
knock at the door, and then people throw themselves
into proper positions and put on their company faces,
and the farce is at an end. No human being, for instance,
could have walked, unannounced, into Miss
Ariana Huntingdon’s boudoir, on that morning when
Mr. Atherton Burney was kneeling at her feet, but the
merry sprites gathered around, and it is a wonder that
he did not hear them shout:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>“Ha! ha! the wooing o’t.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Burney’s courtship was by no means a premeditated
affair. Who ever thinks exactly <span class='it'>how</span> he
shall tell pleasant news? Such, that gentleman thought,
would be the intelligence of his most honorable preference.
And now that Miss Ariana looked coldly on
his suit, he was lost in wonder at the blindness to her
own interest which she exhibited. Like most men,
he never dreamed that a refusal could arise from personal
dislike, and while wounded pride turned his attempt
at a pathetic face into a wry one, he desired to
know the motives which had induced so uncomplimentary
a decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ariana’s face wore the expression of Sir
Joshua Reynold’s “Mucipula,” excepting that it said,
“I have caught a man!” instead of “a mouse;” but
she remembered that a respectable offer must be
respectfully treated, and covering the smile lurking
around her mouth with one of her plump little hands,
she looked as gravely as she could from out her mischievous
hazel eyes. It might have been nervousness
which kept her tiny foot in motion, but it seemed very
like a desire to make a football of her kneeling suitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have two reasons, sir,” she said, “for declining
the honor you intended me. The first is, I have determined
not to marry at all, and the second, that you
are by no means the person likely to make me change
this resolution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Mr. Burney been practicing that exercise in
gymnastics, by which one rises at a single jerk from a
horizontal to an upright position, he could not more
suddenly have changed his suppliant attitude to the
most rigid of perpendiculars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam,” he replied, in that husky voice which
men in a passion assume when trying to appear cool.
“Madam, the first reason is so singular for a person in
your situation, that the second excites no surprise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana was an orphan and dependent upon her brothers-in-law.
Her <span class='it'>piquante</span> face exhibited no irritation
at this insulting remark; although the motion of
her pugnacious little foot was somewhat quickened, a
merry laugh was the only rejoinder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Atherton Burney was prepared for a burst of
indignant scorn, but he found no words to express his
surprise and indignation at this ill-timed mirth; he
wheeled round as if on drill, “right about face,” and
made a “forward march,” which did not terminate till
he found himself, hat in hand, upon the pavement of
Washington Square. His head and his temper being
by this time a little cooled, his few scattering brains
were again packed in their narrow-brimmed receptacle,
and none who met Mr. Atherton Burney that day on
the pavé, suspected that behind his elegant moustache
a refusal was sticking in his throat.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>No two persons are more dissimilar than a gentleman
dining-out, and the same individual quietly taking
a family dinner at home. The smiling guest has a
keen relish for every article placed before him, and
should the rules of etiquette not allow him to express
his gratification in words, he manifests in every possible
way his entire approbation of the cuisine of his host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Andrew Dormer was a favorite guest at the
tables of his wealthy fellow-citizens. His perfect
suavity of manner, his keen appreciation of gastronomic
art, and his skillful carving, won greater favor
than would the possession of the richest treasures of
learning or the highest intellectual endowments. “A
clever fellow,” was Andrew Dormer when dining out.
But, whereas the rules of society require that a guest
should be pleased with every thing, the modern social
economy demands that the master of a family should,
at home, be pleased with nothing. The forementioned
sprites of the air who attended at the family dinners of
the Dormers, were beginning to look a little glum; the
only bright things to be seen on these occasions were
the polished knives and Miss Ariana’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door had scarcely closed after the exit of Mr.
Atherton Burney, when the shuffling and stamping
were heard by which the lord of the mansion was
wont to announce his arrival. Before the meek Mrs.
Dormer obtained a view of that redoubtable personage,
a scolding soliloquy fell upon her trembling ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing ever in order in this house! A mat I
bought only a month ago, all torn to rags! Smell of
dinner coming all the way to the front door! Over-done!
Knew it by the first snuff! Bad servants!
All this comes of a careless mistress. Harriet! Harriet,
I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Andrew?” inquired the soft voice of
Mrs. Dormer, as she put her head timidly out of the
dining-room door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing in this house but rack and ruin,” exclaimed
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
Mr. Dormer, dashing more vinegar into his tone and
manner than either the occasion or his own feelings
required. “What’s the use of buying any thing, I
say, if this is the way it is to be treated?” And he
pointed at the mat, which his own outrageous stamping
had torn to tatters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana had the same instinctive knowledge of a
family feud as the war-horse has of a battle, and rushed
to the charge in her sister’s defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” she exclaimed, “all that hemp left of the
mat you have tried so faithfully to annihilate! When
I heard your last furious attack, I did not think there
would be a single shred remaining in the shape of a
mat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a beseeching look as Mrs. Dormer gave Ariana
as she herself stood trembling in her shoes!</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was the reason, that instead of becoming indignant
at the impertinence of his sister-in-law, Mr.
Dormer tried to look amiable? It might have been
that he read that mischievous glance, which said,
“Ignoble ambition to be a triton among ‘minnows.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Ariana had not been dependent she would have
been less saucy, but so fearful was she of becoming
cringing from interested motives, that she went to the
other extreme, and dared</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“To beard the lion in his den.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The brother-in-law could no more dispense with her
racy society, than with pungent sauces for his piscatory
favorites. Instead of becoming angry when Ariana
declared that she had seen too much of men at home
ever to marry, he was heartily glad of a determination
which insured the continuance under his roof of his
merry antagonist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never was married woman so wretched herself that
she discouraged matrimony among her young relatives
and friends. Scarcely were the Dormers seated at
dinner, and the first outbreak of invectives against cook,
waiter and market-woman at an end, than the meek
Harriet remarked, with an attempt at the playfulness
for which she was distinguished before broken to the
hymenial yoke: “Ariana, you had better have the
ham placed before you, that you may learn to carve,
as I suspect from the visit which you received this
morning that you will soon be at the head of your own
table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dormer checked the grimace by which he was
expressing disgust at the over-done mutton before him,
and stared, but ventured not a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never more mistaken in your life, sister. Mr.
Dormer cannot spare me,” was Ariana’s laughing
reply; “he would burst a blood-vessel in one of his
fury-fits, if I were not here to soothe him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I such a tyrant then?” asked Mr. Dormer, in
nearly as humble a tone as his wife would have used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very despot; but not worse at heart than most
men. There is scarcely one who does not revenge
himself for the rude world’s buffetings, by inflicting
all sorts of petty annoyances upon those at home,” was
the calm reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will certainly be an old maid, Ariana,” remarked
Mrs. Dormer, as she cast a furtive glance at
the engrossing object of all her thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A consummation devoutly to be wished,” said
Ariana, smiling at the fearful tone in which the remark
was made. “I had rather be caged in a menagerie,
than obliged from morning to night to listen to the
growling of a human tiger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Atherton Burney is very mild, and only needs a
gentle shepherdess to make him perfectly lamb-like,”
said Mr. Dormer, with an attempt at sportiveness
which reminded his sister of the fabled donkey emulating
the lap-dog’s playfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never liked pastorals,” she began, but the time
for joking was at an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The servant, in handing Mr. Dormer a glass of
water, spilled part of the contents upon his plate, and
stood trembling at the angry rebuke which his carelessness
had called forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Misnamed lords of creation,” thought Ariana for
the hundredth time, as she saw what a trifle had disturbed
her brother’s equanimity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a dead silence for a few moments, only
broken by the clatter of knives and forks, and then Mr.
Dormer, casting very much such a glance at his sister-in-law
as a naughty boy would at his offended mamma,
muttered—“the steamer is in to-day and the banks are
breaking faster than ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Dormer looked sympathetic at this intelligence,
and Ariana remarked kindly—“Business troubles you
then! It must be very tormenting,” and a suspicion
flashed across her mind that men, after all, might
sometimes have an excuse for their ill-humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if we are to lose our money, let us keep our
temper,” she added, as she rose to leave the table.
Then turning to her sister she said—“Don’t sit up for
me, Harriet. If I am not at home before nine, I shall
stay all night at sister Jane’s—she sent for me to spend
the evening with her, and—and you know it is always
quite uncertain whether Mr. Daley will be in a humor
to escort me home.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were only sure that fishes did not feel, I should
not mind hooking them,” said a lad of tender heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Ariana Huntingdon was convinced that men
did not feel, and therefore had not the <a id='slig'></a>slightest scruple
in taking captive as many as came within range of her
fascinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had the misanthropical little coquette been old, or
ugly, the stronger sex would have risen in a body to
expel her from the city, but being very young and very
pretty, they seemed to love her all the better for her
alledged heresy as to man’s supremacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is one of the most beautiful apparitions that I
ever met,” said a young gentleman who caught a
glimpse of our heroine upon a fashionable promenade,
crowded with insipid faces, whose fair unmeaningness
was made more conspicuous from being contrasted
with the gayest of colors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ashes of roses” would have been the only appropriate
hue for some of these <span class='it'>passé</span> damsels, of whose
bloom certainly but the cinders were remaining, on
which the marks of their former beauty were faintly
traced in flittering characters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a peculiar freshness and individuality in
Ariana’s appearance, arising from her clear, original
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
intellect, which made her always noticed, even by
those who did not admire the piquant style of her
beauty. Then her dress, without trespassing upon the
mode of the season, bore some tasteful addition, so
unique, that it was at once surmised that she must be
very <span class='it'>distingué</span> to be allowed such independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame Bonheurie has not a hat trimmed in that
manner,” said a characterless parvenu, who could
not have afforded even a ribbon without a pedigree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The article of dress, thus criticised, was a hat of
delicate rose-color, but, alas! instead of wearing the stiff
top-knots of ribbon which were then in vogue, Ariana
had arranged the trimming so as to drop upon one side,
without hiding the swan-like throat of its <span class='it'>petite</span>
wearer. Her mantle, too, though unexceptionable in
the richness and color of the velvet, was but slightly
trimmed, and its graceful sleeves were quite unlike the
stiff armlets through which some fair ladies’ hands
were peeping in unnatural constraint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana, while smiling sweetly on her acquaintances,
so moderated her tokens of favor upon this particular
day, that no one stepped to her side to offer their escort,
for she was deep in meditation,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I really anxious to be an old maid?” was the
question she was revolving in her own mind, and
every antiquated maiden whom she met seemed to
weigh against the affirmative that an hour since she
would have been ready to pronounce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” however, sprung to her lips as she entered
the parlor of Professor Daley, or rather study, as it
might more appropriately be named. All signs of
<a id='fem'></a>feminine refinement were neutralised in this uncomfortable
apartment by huge piles of books, placed where
most convenient for that gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Mrs. Daley flew into a passion on the subject, and
declared that she had seldom a place where a guest
could be seated, he took up another volume, and perhaps,
laid the one he had been reading upon the only
vacant chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the rudest man in the world, Madison,”
was Ariana’s involuntary exclamation, as her learned
connection gave her a kind of <span class='it'>chin bow</span> when she entered
the apartment, without appearing to favor her
with a single glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what I always tell him,” rejoined Jane,
who seemed, as is the case with some one in most
families, to have absorbed all the spirit intended amply
to endow the whole; “read, read, from morning till
night. I might as well have no husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like the boy under stoical tuition, if Mr. Daley had
learned nothing else from philosophy, it had enabled
him to meet reproach with perfect calmness. It is
questionable, however, if that mode of meeting reproach
is a virtue, which instead of turning away wrath, infuriates
it beyond all bounds. Mr. Daley’s perfect
indifference to the happiness of every living thing, was
the alkali to the acid of Mrs. Daley’s character, and
produced violent fermentation. How cold those blue
eyes of his looked through the green spectacles worn
to repair the effect of constant study by lamp-light! It
would have been well if the carpet could have been
defended from the effects of these nocturnal vigils, as
many a spot was visible in spite of the constant wear
which had reduced the once elastic Brussels to a floor-cloth
consistency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Home, to the man of science, was only a place where
the torch of mind was to be re-lighted; his wife, a
being who fed it with oil, and her house the mere laboratory
used for those supplies of a physical nature
which made the ethereal flame burn purer and brighter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a pity it is that all who are destined to play
the part of cyphers have not a taste for nonentity!
Mrs. Daley, as she often told her husband, who, however,
had not once seemed to hear the remark, “never
dreamed before her marriage that it would come to
this.” To be sure he had been a different man as a
lover, but it is one of the standing wonders of the
world how the wise and great ever condescended to
the foolishness of courting; yet philosophers in love
are always lamentably absent, and being quite out of
their element, flounder away more boisterously than
any other kind of fish, but marriage puts them again at
ease, and then their cold blood creeps on uninterrupted
in its sluggish course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old maid or not old maid,” again passed through
Ariana’s mind as her eyes rested on Mr. Daley’s boots,
which, in their turn, rested upon the marble mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Literary men are I presume all just such bears, and
men of business like Andrew.” Single-blessedness
would have carried the day had not the most finical
of her maiden acquaintance arisen to efface the images
of the brothers-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do these old books make you happy, Madison
Daley?” she asked, when her sister was quite exhausted
with the relation of her grievances. The
Professor had been caught looking up at the cessation
of the sound of his wife’s tongue, which he seemed to
have imagined was to be perpetual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One cannot pretend to deafness as easily when they
meet the eye of a questioner, and a cold “Yes,” fell from
the thin lips of the philosopher. He instantly resumed
reading a “Treatise upon the promotion of individual
happiness, as the only certain way of enhancing national
prosperity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a lucky thing for Ariana, that with her quick
perception of character she had so strong a love for the
ludicrous, for what otherwise might have aroused her
indignation now only excited her mirth. The incongruity
between Professor Daley’s philanthropic studies
and his habitual selfishness, struck her as so droll that
she burst into a merry peal of laughter. The astonished
glance of the Professor at this sudden merriment
said quite plainly, “Is the girl demented?” and Jane’s
querulous voice, still more audibly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is easy enough to laugh at other people’s misfortunes!
I only wish that I may live to see you married,
and yet as much alone and as dependent on
your own exertions, as if you had no natural protector.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana knew by long experience that her sister considered
Mr. Daley’s faults as her exclusive property,
and wished others to speak of him always as if he were
a model of a man. When she spoke in society herself
of her learned husband, no one would have dreamed
that she had discovered the feet of her idol to be of
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
clay, but in <span class='it'>tête-à-têtes</span> she even insinuated to him
that they were slightly cloven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana had a good share of mother wit, and knew
very well the wisdom of exciting a counteracting
passion when she had subjected herself to reproof by
her open disrespect toward her learned brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me, sister,” she said soothingly, “that
you expected company, and my aid would be needed
in preparing for their reception.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All Mrs. Daley’s motions were sudden, and at this
remark she started up, exclaiming, “There! I have
not given half my orders in the kitchen, and I dare
say that the children have put the dining-room all out
of order while I have been talking here. Do go and
see to them, while I tell Betty what linen to put on the
bed in the spare room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One would have thought that the dining-room might
have been sacred to eating and drinking, but the Professor
had insisted on piling the surplus of his library
in one corner of this cold, parlor-looking apartment.
People have various ideas of comfort, but to Ariana’s
eyes the disorder which her pretty little niece and
nephew had caused was rather an improvement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archie had built a very respectable house out of the
Encyclopedias, and a large stone inkstand, which
luckily was corked, served very well, when turned
upside down, for a parlor centre-table. A smaller one
and an accompanying sand-box, from his mother’s
escritoir, answered for ottomans, and upon them two
table-napkins, with strings round their waists, to improve
their figures, were sitting up, quite like ladies
and gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bright faces of Archie and Etta wore a troubled
expression, at the opening of the door, but it turned to
one of unfeigned delight as they both scampered toward
Ariana, exclaiming—“Oh, aunty, come and see
our pretty baby-house. We have found out such a
nice way of using pa’s tiresome old books.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like the cat transformed to a lady, who always
showed her feline origin at the sight of a mouse, Ariana
seemed always to return to childhood when in
company with Archie and Etta. Mrs. Daley might as
well have set a monkey to keep them out of mischief,
for down dropped the moderator on the floor beside
the baby-house, and commenced twisting the napkins
into most ludicrous imitations of humanity. Etta finding
that while her aunty was thus employed, she could
get a nice chance at playing with her hair, slily drew
out the comb and fell to “turling it” over her little
fingers, while Archie clapped his hands and danced
about in wild delight at the beauty of the napkin ladies
and gentlemen—Hark! there was a footstep in the
hall—no! two. The door opened and the Professor,
with scarcely a glance at the occupants of the room,
thrust into it a tall, fine-looking stranger, and merely
saying, “My sister-in-law, Cousin Arthur,” retreated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana was so much amused at this strange introduction
of the visiter, that she scarcely thought of her
own disordered appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, brother Madison has ejected you, sir, from his
study at once,” she said smiling. “His way of making
people completely at home is by turning them out of
his own door. Do take a seat with us children, and
my sister will be here presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur Grayson had a great respect for his cousin,
the Professor, having never seen him in domestic life,
and only knowing his high reputation among the scientific
men of the day. He was ignorant of the reason
why Ariana spoke in so disrespectful a tone of so near
a connection, and it seemed a want of politeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No beauty can atone for such rudeness,” he thought
to himself, but replied courteously, “My cousin probably
knew what society I should find most entertaining,
and I am glad that he did not allow me to trespass
upon his time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Ariana could answer this remark, Jane
emerged from a staircase leading to the kitchen, with
a bowl in her hand, exclaiming, “Do, Ariana, stir up
this cake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her surprise at the sight of the stranger, the bowl
slipped from her hand and fell on the floor, scattering
its yet fluid contents in every direction. Our pretty
man-hater turned mischievously toward Arthur Grayson,
to observe how he bore the bespattering of the
very elegant suit of broadcloth in which his unexceptionable
form was enveloped, but instead of betraying
any marks of irritation, he said with perfect self-command
and good-humor, “I presume that the dispenser
of such good things can only be that Lady Bountiful,
my Cousin Jane, of whose open-handed hospitality I
have often heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could never have been said of Mrs. Daly that she
was</p>

          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='line0'>“Mistress of herself though china fall.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And to have lost china and cake both together was
quite too severe a trial of her patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana immediately came to her relief, by saying to
the guest very politely, “Will you walk into the study
with me, sir? I assure you that Madison does not
care how many people are there, so he is saved from
the task of entertaining them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all the fault of that selfish animal,” she added
mentally. “What is the use of all the learning in the
world if unmixed with a particle of common sense?”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A week after Arthur Grayson’s arrival in the city,
the following letter was received at his father’s delightful
residence on the banks of the Susquehanna:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My dearest Mother</span>,—Were it not for the domestic
happiness I have witnessed at home, I should
begin to believe that no literary man ought ever to
marry. When I remember your anecdotes of the mischievous
pranks of little Madison Daley, and then look
at his immovable face, I can scarcely believe that he
is the same individual. His soul, during the last seven
years, must have as completely changed as the elements
of that stiff-knit frame, which day and night is
bent over some ponderous volume, for not an atom of
playfulness or bonhommie now enters into his composition.
Perhaps a ‘silent loving woman’ might have
retarded this metamorphosis, but Cousin Jane is of
quite a different class. Out of respect to you, dear
mother, I try always to think that women are free
from blame, and sincerely commiserate the philosopher’s
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
wife, who makes me thoroughly uncomfortable,
by trying to make me comfortable, and her children
wretched, in endeavoring to bring them up properly.
Her promised visit to Castleton, will, I am sure, be a
green spot in her existence, and the mummy husband
makes no opposition to the excursion. Will you have
the kindness to include in your invitation, Miss Ariana
Huntingdon, a sister of Madison’s wife, whom I
should like you to know as a peculiar specimen of
womanhood? She has wit and beauty enough to fascinate
any man, were it not for her having conceived
so thorough and unfeminine a contempt for mankind,
that she is often guilty of such rudeness that my heart
resists all her attractions. Andrew Dormer and Madison
Daley are not, it is true, such men as would give any
person of discernment a high respect for our sex, yet
it is a mark of a little mind to condemn whole classes
for the faults of individuals. Then Miss Ariana is an
arrant little coquette, insisting that it is of service to a
man to break his heart, as it will have a little softness
ever afterward, whereas it otherwise would continue
all stone. We have many pleasant tilts on these subjects,
and when pushed for a reason, she always maintains
her cause by such cunning sarcasms, that I am
obliged to own myself defeated. ‘Men at home!’ is
her frequent exclamation, in a tone of perfect contempt,
at any new proof of the selfishness of her brothers-in-law.
I wonder if she would dare to utter this sneer at
the lords of creation, after seeing my honored father
under his own hospitable roof. Please say to him that
I have almost completed the business entrusted to my
care, and shall return home in two weeks from to-morrow.
Till then, I remain as ever,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“Your devoted son,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Arthur Grayson</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“This old study is not such a disagreeable room
after all,” said Ariana, as she was ensconced in the
low window-seat, with Arthur Grayson beside her.
They were hidden from the view of her brother-in-law
by his long overcoat, which no remonstrances
could induce him to have hung elsewhere. “Madison
has probably discovered that the parlors of Herculaneum
were thus ornamented,” she continued, pointing
to a pair of boots which were standing in the midst of
the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a very pleasant room to me,” he replied,
“and I shall long remember the hours spent here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A glance of joy shot from Ariana’s eyes, but it passed
away as she thought, “I dare say both of my brothers-in-law
used to say just such agreeable things before
they were married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I ever meet with a man who
tries to be disagreeable, I shall believe that he is
sincere,” she replied, somewhat pettishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you suspect me of hypocrisy?” said
Arthur, coldly. “I remarked that our pleasant chats
had cheated me of many weary hours; you cannot
doubt that this is the case. I neither said nor intended
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana had always applauded sincerity, but this frank
avowal did not meet her approbation. The <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span>
was becoming awkward, and was luckily interrupted
at this juncture by the ring of the postman. A letter
was handed to Mr. Grayson; it contained a note which
he gave to Miss Huntingdon. She blushed at seeing
that it bore the signature of Isabella Grayson, and was
penned in a feminine hand, of remarkable delicacy and
beauty. The flush on her cheek grew absolutely
crimson, as she read the polite invitation to accompany
her sister on a visit to Castleton the ensuing month.
At that moment Arthur Grayson was wishing that he
had not induced his mother to extend her hospitality, as
Ariana had of late openly announced her predilections
for single blessedness, and had at the same time been
so bewitchingly agreeable, that he began to feel that her
society was dangerous to his peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear I must decline this invitation,” said she,
after a pause of some minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what reason?” he asked, while his dark eyes
were fixed in close scrutiny upon her varying countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana blushed still deeper, and then attempted to
smile, but a tear stole to her eye as she replied with
great frankness, “We have spent so many delightful
hours together that your memory will be very pleasant,
but I am afraid that the charm would be broken if I
were to see you at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This confession almost drew from Arthur one of
still deeper import, but a remembrance flashed upon
him of all he had heard of Ariana’s coquetry, and he
merely replied, “If that is all, I will remain away from
Castleton, rather than deprive my mother and Mrs.
Daley of the pleasure of your society.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This proposition, however, was by no means agreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” she exclaimed, “I have no idea of exiling
you on my account, only promise to try and not be
very disagreeable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This pledge was easily given. Soon after a messenger
arrived to say that Mr. Dormer was quite unwell,
and begged that Mrs. Daley would spare Ariana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If there be any where in the world a striking instance
of the fallen pride of humanity, a sick man affords the
example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ariana returned, Mr. Dormer was lying on
the sofa, in the parlor, in his gay dressing-gown, having
absolutely refused to go to his chamber and be regularly
treated as a patient. Harriet stood by him with
a wine-glass of medicine in one hand, and a saucer of
sweetmeats in the other, trying to coax the invalid to
swallow the dose she had so carefully prepared for him.
The naughtiest of boys never made up such rueful
faces, or protested more willfully against the disagreeable
injunction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no use,” he said at last, angrily; “I’d
rather die than swallow such stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, dear Andrew, what could I do without you?”
said the affectionate Mrs. Dormer, now almost in tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden and violent pain made her husband inclined
to change his resolution, and snatching the glass,
he said, “There, give me the <a id='sweet'></a>sweetmeats, quick.”
With much writhing and choking, he swallowed a
dose which one of his children would have taken
without a murmur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter, Andrew?” asked Ariana,
kindly, as she stepped to his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Matter enough,” he replied, “my stomach is
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>
entirely ruined by the horrid messes on which I have
been fed for the last month. A horse could not have
stood the cooking to which I have been forced to
submit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dormer, after smoking his digestive organs out
of order, in spite of the remonstrances of his friends,
now actually believed that he was an injured man,
victimised by a bad cook and a careless wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a miserable week as followed this scene had
rarely fallen to Ariana’s lot, but she was really grateful
to Mr. Dormer for his disinterested kindness to her,
and relieved her sister of much trouble and care.
Every day that detained the peevish patient from his
business made him still more unreasonable and exacting.
He would have been well much sooner if any
one could have induced him to obey the orders of the
physician. After a dose of calomel, he would insist
on a hearty dinner of beef-steak, and when purposely
kept in a low state to prevent the danger of fever,
called loudly for wine or brandy, declaring that his
wife would like nothing better than to see his strength
so reduced that there could be no hope of his recovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The servants were so exhausted with his caprices
that the chambermaid took French leave, and then
Mrs. Dormer, who had double duty to perform, was
taxed with inattention to his wants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if Arthur Grayson has a strong constitution?”
was the question which passed through Ariana’s
mind, as she witnessed the daily martyrdom of her
meek sister. Now the dressing was all torn from the
blisters of the impatient invalid, then the covering
thrown off, and a moment after a complaint made that
some outer door had been left open on purpose to freeze
him to death. Every dose of medicine was taken
with a struggle, every word of advice regarded as an
infringement on his rights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where was that clever fellow, Andrew Dormer?
What would the merchants on ’change have said to the
transformation? Nothing, we presume, for like himself,
they were few of them clever fellows to their
own wives and servants.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It is quite an objection to rail-roads and steamboats
that they present so few inconveniences as to give one
but little opportunity of discovering the temper and
good-breeding of their fellow passengers. Nobody is
crowded within, nobody has to sit without, no one is
sick on the back seat, or lacks support on the middle
one, as used to be the case in those dear old stage-coaches,
where persons were shaken out of all ceremony,
and jostled into a pleasant acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A private carriage, however, if well filled, has still
its points of trial; and the Grayson equipage, when
packed with the Daley family, promises to exercise
the patience of its inmates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, the ladies were too modern to be troubled
with bandboxes; but Mrs. Daley’s beautiful traveling-bag,
which had been worked by her sister, needed as
much tending as a baby; and the bouquet of flowers,
which Ariana was carrying from a city green-house to
Mrs. Grayson, in a tin case, wanted great care, being
sprinkled every time that the horses were watered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur Grayson had been early schooled to consider
annoyance at petty evils as totally unworthy of a man
of sense, and there was no affectation in his indifference
to his own ease while making the ladies as comfortable
as lay within his power. He even succeeded in
beguiling Etty from Ariana’s arm to his own, and Jane’s
brow grew smoother at every mile, from finding the
children so easily amused. Archie Daley had a quick
inquiring mind, and drank in eagerly all the information
which his friend gave with regard to the objects
that they passed on the road. At length, wearied with
pleasure, he fell asleep, leaning his whole weight on
Arthur’s, while Etta slumbered on his breast, as much
at home as if in her nurse’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana had been unusually silent during the journey.
The peculiar gentleness of her companion, his delicate
attentions to Jane and herself, with his sweet consideration
for the children, and carelessness of his own comfort,
made her wish that the journey might be long, and
suggested the thought how happy any one would be,
who should enjoy such protection through life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These reflections gave an unusual softness to her
generally vivacious manners, which was peculiarly
attractive; and Arthur, as he glanced at the little
sleeper on his bosom, and then at the sweet smile on
Ariana’s face, had his own dreams also of domestic
bliss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These gentle thoughts had not faded from the hearts
of our travelers, nor the light of the setting sun from
the evening sky, when they entered the open gates of
Castleton. An elderly gentleman, of noble appearance,
stood on the porch of his fine mansion, to welcome the
strangers. His dignified yet kindly manners impressed
Ariana with instant respect, but she felt a still deeper
emotion in receiving the cordial greetings of Mrs.
Grayson. Arthur’s mother was still a beautiful woman,
though her hair was slightly silvered with age,
for her dark eye was intellectually bright, while a
smile of uncommon sweetness played around her
pleasant mouth. The heart of the orphan was touched
by the motherly kindness of tone with which she was
welcomed; and as she heard the joyful greeting which
Arthur received from both his parents, and the tender
respect with which it was returned, she felt that there
was a happiness in domestic life of which she had
scarcely dreamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must not forget your health, Mary, in our
pleasure at seeing our friends,” said Judge Grayson,
to his wife, as he gently placed her arm in his, and led
the way to the cheerful parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much expression there is in the interior of any
dwelling! That tastefully ornamented room, provided
with every comfort for the elder members of the
family, and filled with materials of amusements for all
persons of cultivated minds, breathed nothing but peace
and joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur placed a footstool at his mother’s feet, and
then rang for a servant, to show the ladies to their
apartment, while Judge Grayson was helping them to
disencumber themselves from some of their numerous
wrappings. Archie had loitered to take a ride on the
porch, where he had spied a rocking-horse, which had
been brought down from the garret with a view to his
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
amusement, while Etty had caught up a kitten which
seemed used to nothing but kindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an excellent housekeeper Mrs. Grayson appears
to be!” was Jane’s exclamation, the moment that
they reached their apartment. “They say that the
judge is a learned man, but I do not see any thing that
looks like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A disorderly dwelling, and a cold, disagreeable man
at its head, were to Mrs. Daley, alas! the usual indications
of the abode of literature. She had not noticed
that one little cabinet of books in the parlor, contained
some very profound works, and that the large room
opposite, was a well furnished library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beautiful art of making others happy had been
so completely studied by Mrs. Grayson, that before
the evening passed away, Mrs. Daley and her sister
scarcely remembered that they were guests. As
Ariana began to feel perfectly at home, her natural
vivacity arose, and the judge smiled pleasantly at her
lively rejoinders to the playful remarks of his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now and then Mrs. Grayson looked up a little
seriously, from her conversation on family affairs with
Jane, as if afraid that Arthur might be tempted to some
slight rudeness, in replying to the gay sallies of his
companion.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When Ariana awoke the next morning, she feared
that her last night’s enjoyment had been all a dream;
but a glance around her chamber convinced her that
at least she was not in the habitation of either of her
sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of a loud, manly voice below, fully restored
her to consciousness, and with it came the tormenting
thought that it must be Judge Grayson. I am
afraid that after all he is like other men at Home, was
her mental ejaculation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice came nearer, but its tones were not harsh,
and Ariana now distinctly heard the words, “Up, up,
Arthur! Your mother wishes a letter sent to the village,
and we ride there on horseback before breakfast.
Hurry, my boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I am, sir, booted and spurred,” was distinctly
audible, in a gay, yet respectful tone. And then the
cheerful voices of father and son, as they mounted
their horses and rode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take another muffin, Miss Ariana,” said the
judge, as they sat at breakfast. “It may be vanity,
but I think my wife always manages to have nicer
muffins than are found any where else in the whole
country. I know Arthur is of the same opinion, for
he gives us the best possible proof of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The son gave a smiling assent, and Ariana thought
of Andrew Dormer and his habit of finding fault with
every thing that was placed before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not much the fashion at the present day for
young men to consult their parents with regard to their
love affairs, but Arthur Grayson walked closely in the
footsteps of his father, and he was a gentleman of the
old school. Were this mode more prevalent, there
would not be so many unhappy mothers-in-law and
such miserable wives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visiters from the city had spent two days at
Castleton before Arthur could ask his mother’s advice
about the subject which lay nearest his heart. The
moment, however, that he found an opportunity of
speaking to her alone, he said, eagerly, “What do you
think of Ariana?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A question that I am not yet qualified to answer,
my son,” was her reply, while she looked earnestly
into his troubled face, as if seeking to discover how
deeply he was interested in the inquiry, which he had
just made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not like her, I see plainly,” he hastily remarked,
in a tone of bitter disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are much mistaken in that supposition, my
dear Arthur. On the contrary, her frankness and
talents interest me exceedingly, and even her faults
make me anxious for a more intimate acquaintance,
for I think that I might be of service in aiding her to
overcome them. I am not sure, however, that she
would be a suitable companion for life for my darling
son, if that is what you wish to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must not stay here any longer,” he exclaimed,
impetuously. “I have too much confidence
in your judgment to believe that I could ever be happy
with any one, of whose character you disapproved. I
feared that it would be so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too hasty, Arthur. Why does the opinion
I have expressed make it necessary for you to leave
home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I have discovered that I love her too
well to trust myself longer in her society,” he answered,
with agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are right in your resolution. Why do
you not make your long promised visit to Carysford
Lee? If I find on further acquaintance that Ariana is
worthy of your affection, you shall not long remain in
ignorance of the conclusion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” Arthur replied, and then sorrow of
heart prevented him from adding more, but kissing
affectionately his mother’s pale cheek, he hastily left
the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana’s face was radiant with smiles when she
descended to the dining-room. Her gayety, however,
quickly disappeared when Arthur, who sat next to her
at the table, asked abruptly, “Have you any commands
for my friend, Lee? I am going this afternoon
to Allendale, to remain with him for a few weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily for Ariana, Jane immediately exclaimed,
“What, going to run away from us so soon. How
will the children get along without you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t go, sir!” said Archie, mournfully.
“I cannot finish my new bow without your help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will show you about it,” said the judge, kindly,
“and take you to ride on horseback behind me, just as
Arthur has done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Ariana had recovered her composure,
and said, with an attempt at gayety, “What a delightful
time we ladies shall have with none to molest
or make us afraid. The only fear will be, that I shall
quite forget my saucy ways if I have no one to practice
them upon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose you should make me a target for your wit,”
said the judge, playfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
“My weapons would only rebound upon myself,
with so invulnerable a mark,” she replied, in a respectful
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A conversation, in which evident constraint was
visible, followed, and every one glad when the meal
was at last over. An hour afterward Arthur’s horse
was brought round to the door, and with an air of
extreme embarrassment, he bade Mrs. Daley and
Ariana a hasty farewell. The assumed indifference
of the latter was so well counterfeited, that her lover
rode away with the full conviction that his absence
was considered as a relief.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, Judge Grayson was obliged to
leave Castleton to attend a court at a neighboring village,
and the ladies were left in sole possession of the
mansion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dull it is here to-day,” said Ariana, to her
sister, as they were <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span>, while Mrs. Grayson
was occupied with domestic affairs. “I just saw a
pair of boots at the door of the opposite chamber, and
it was <a id='act'></a>actually a delightful sight. I really think that
everlasting overcoat of Madison’s would be a pleasant
addition to our prospect in this dearth of mankind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jane was delighted at a chance to revenge herself
for all Ariana’s attacks upon the odd ways of the
professor. “What ails you,” she said, “to make such
strange remarks? They come very unexpectedly from
such a professed man-hater. Why I have heard you
say, that Eden could not be a Paradise to you, if men
were allowed to enter it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let by-gones be by-gones, Jenny. We grow wiser
every day,” said Ariana, playfully. “Do you need
me here this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I shall be busy in copying these receipts for
cake, but if you will have an eye to the children who
are down stairs, I shall be obliged to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana took up her basket containing a pair of slippers,
which she was working for Andrew Dormer, and
went into the parlor, where she hoped to find Mrs.
Grayson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That lady was, however, not there, but soon came
in, and setting down her work, commenced one of
those easy, confidential chats, which make two people
better acquainted than years of intercourse in general
society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to ask a question, which you will think
very strange,” said Ariana, at length, “but it would
make me so much happier if I was certain about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, dear?” asked the kind lady, with a
benevolent smile, which encouraged curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you then tell me,” said Ariana, hesitatingly,
“if Judge Grayson is always as kind and agreeable at
home as he appears to us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears rose to Mrs. Grayson’s eyes as she answered,
“He has never been otherwise. I could not
with propriety have replied to your question if I had
not testimony to bear to his never failing love and
kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! how glad I am!” exclaimed Ariana, with a
fervency that startled her companion. “All the men
I know are so disagreeable in their own homes, and so
neglectful of the comfort of their wives, that I thought
the rest of the world were like them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too true, my child,” said Mrs. Grayson,
kindly, “that there are those who sacrifice their private
peace to their public duties, or <a id='exi'></a>exhibit at home the
vexation consequent upon lives of constant toil and
anxiety. Even where this is the case, however, it is
a woman’s duty to give her home all the cheerfulness
in her power; and if her husband is not in private life
what she could wish, the secret should be confined to
her own bosom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Grayson was one of the few persons who can
give advice so discreetly as not to wound the feelings
of the person whom they are trying to benefit. Her
last remark made Ariana feel the impropriety of having
allowed the faults of her brothers-in-law, who were
generous, indeed, though their manners were often so
disagreeable. Her confession in this respect was so
frankly made, that it won upon Mrs. Grayson’s affection,
and their conversation continued in a still more
confidential tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day Ariana would glide down into the
parlor, to enjoy a <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span> with her new friend, while
Jane was occupied with her receipts, and the children
busy at play. Her laughing philosophy was only the
armor of pride, and her warm, generous feelings gushed
forth unrestrained, in conversing with Mrs. Grayson.
The sportive bursts of humor, which were so perfectly
natural to her lively disposition, awoke in the
elder lady some of the vivacity of her early years, and
Jane would be startled from her monotonous employment,
by the sound of their merry laughter. Insensibly
the bright, impulsive girl was winding around the
heart of her friend, in trying to win whose approbation
her own character was rapidly improving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only one subject on which there was not
perfect confidence between Mrs. Grayson and Ariana.
Arthur’s name was never mentioned by either of them.
Ariana could not with delicacy, tell his mother how
bitterly she was grieved at his departure, but her languid
eyes, and frequently wandering thoughts, revealed
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, when at evening Judge Grayson returned
from court, she saw the affectionate meeting
with his dear wife, she would sigh deeply, as if looking
on happiness that could never be her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The six weeks which Mrs. Daley intended to spend
at Castleton, had passed rapidly away. On the morrow
the family were to return to the city, and all regretted
the necessity for their separation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Ariana sat listening to the regrets of Mrs. Grayson
and her sister that their intercourse was so soon to be
terminated, she was unable to command her spirits,
and under pretence of breathing the fresh air, walked
out upon the piazza. She stood looking toward the
stars in melancholy abstraction, when a gentleman
came suddenly around the corner of the house, and
stood at her side. “Mr. Grayson!” she exclaimed,
with such unaffected joy, that a smile of delight beamed
on his face as he eagerly seized her proffered hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you not then know that I was to return this
evening?” he asked. “Could you think that I would
allow you to depart without saying farewell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
“You left us so abruptly, that I did not know what
to expect,” she replied, blushing deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you not object to coming here lest my presence
should mar your enjoyment?” he inquired,
mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know,” she replied, with warmth, “what
was the reason for that silly remark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why silly? If seeing me at home might destroy
your respect, it was quite wise to send me into banishment,”
he remarked, playfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I could not have done so, I am sure, now,”
she replied, earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you really sufficient faith in any man to believe
him free from the faults which I have so often
heard you impute to the whole sex?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was put in a jesting tone, but Arthur
listened eagerly for her reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father’s constant politeness has overcome all
those foolish prejudices. I do believe that his son may
resemble him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you dare to trust your happiness to the
keeping of that son?” he asked, with tender earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should,” she replied with characteristic promptness,
while a tear glistened in her eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why may not this place henceforth be your
home. My mother already loves you dearly, and my
father’s approbation sanctions my suit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana’s consent was easily won to this proposition,
and then Arthur went to announce his own arrival to
the family circle, while she stole to her apartment to
compose her agitated heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Daley insisted that Ariana should remain with
her a month previous to her marriage, and then Mrs.
Dormer pleaded for a visit of equal length. Andrew
would have been quite out of humor at her loss, were
it not for the pleasure of hearing that she had given up
her rebellious thoughts as to man’s supremacy. The
professor was so much ameliorated by Jane’s more
prudent conduct, that he presented the bride elect with
a set of very dry books, in token of regard for her
choice. Mr. Dormer made her many valuable gifts,
though his manner of bestowing favors almost neutralized
the pleasure which he otherwise would have
conferred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ariana Huntingdon has been for many years a
happy wife. Arthur Grayson has found that well
regulated wit and cheerful independence, heighten
domestic life; and Ariana asserts that men deserve the
title of Lords of Creation, and that her Arthur, to
be fully appreciated, must be seen “at Home.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>We will take a brief retrospect of the last two years
in the life of Crayford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon a pleasant summer evening, two gentlemen,
mounted on fine, spirited steeds, came gayly cantering
down the gentle slope of a hill, and across the rustic
bridge which formed the entrance to a small village in
the interior of Pennsylvania, just as a party of merry
milk-maids were returning the same way from the
green pastures beyond. The road, or rather lane, was
here quite narrow, and observing the rapid approach
of the equestrians, the girls hastily stepping aside into
the deep grass, stood still for them to pass by. Instead
of doing so, however, they slackened their pace, and
one of them <a id='rein'></a>reining in his steed, gazed impertinently
into the blushing faces of the village girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By heavens!” he exclaimed, in a low voice to his
companion, “what a pair of eyes that little witch has
in the blue petticoat—and what a shape! look at her,
Hastings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The damsel thus pointed out could not have been
more than sixteen. In face and form a perfect Hebe,
with a most superb pair of laughing black eyes, shaded
by long curling lashes. Her little sun-bonnet was
thrown off, but rested loosely upon her shoulders; her
hair, which was as black and brilliant as her eyes, was
cut short to her beautiful neck, and clustered in tight
ringlets over her finely formed head, upon the top of
which sat her pail of foaming milk. With one hand
she held it lightly poised, while the other rested upon
her hip, in an attitude most graceful and picturesque.
Her petticoat was of dark-blue bombazet, set off by a
white muslin short-gown reaching half way to the
knees, where it was finished with a narrow frilling—a
dress still in vogue among the farmers’ daughters both
in Pennsylvania and New England—and a very pretty
dress it is, too. Her little feet were bare, hiding themselves
modestly in the tall grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girl is an angel—a perfect divinity!” replied
Hastings, after a rude stare at the young maid, “What
a sensation she would make—eh, Crayford!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, Hastings,” added the other, with a devilish
leer, “it will be worth our while to stay here a day or
two—what say you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this Hastings returned a significant wink, which
was responded to by the other in the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During these remarks they had rode slowly on, but
now suddenly wheeling his horse, Crayford once more
approached the little group, and lifting his hat, bowed
most gracefully as he said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you tell me, fair maidens, where my friend and
myself may be so fortunate as to find a night’s lodging?
We are somewhat fatigued with a long day’s ride, and
would fain rest our weary limbs, as also our jaded
steeds. Can you direct us, then, to some public house
in your village?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sprightly blue-eyed girl, delighted to be of service
to the polite stranger, stepped quickly forward, and
said, while her cheeks grew redder and redder, and her
eyes rounded with every word:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, yes, sir, there is a good tavern at the other end
of the village, and here is Effie Day, she lives there, you
know, for it is her grandfather who keeps the house;
here, Effie, you will show the gentleman the way,
wont you Effie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all the saints, how lucky!” whispered Crayford,
to his friend—Effie proving to be no other than
the identical maiden who had so charmed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Springing from his horse, and throwing the reins to
Hastings with a meaning glance, Crayford lifted the
pail from the head of the blushing girl, and begged the
privilege of assisting her with her burden, while she
acted as his guide to the inn. The girls all laughed
merrily at this, but Effie, blushing still deeper, drew
her sun-bonnet closely over her face, and tripped lightly
on before him, so fleetly, too, whether from bashfulness
or mischief, that her gallant could scarcely keep
pace with her twinkling feet. On reaching the inn, his
fair guide suddenly disappeared, leaving Crayford to
dispose of the milk-pail as he could, to the no small
delight of Hastings, who highly enjoyed the evident
discomfiture of his friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old landlord welcomed the strangers heartily,
and gave them the best rooms his house could boast,
and soon placed before them an excellent supper. But
what gave it its true zest was the attendance of the
pretty milk-maid—and a more lovely cup-bearer never
served the gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Effie Day was but an infant when both her
parents were taken from her by death, and no other
home had she ever known than the roof of her kind
old grandfather. With a tenderness far exceeding that
which they had felt for their own children did her
grandparents regard her, and in pity for her orphan
state, indulged her in every wish which it was in their
power to grant. As she grew up her beauty and
vivacity was their pride, and no theme could sooner
reach their hearts than the praises of their darling
Effie. She was brought up in all the simplicity of
country life; a circuit of ten miles the boundary of her
little world, and from books her knowledge was scarcely
more. Yet the birds which sang at her window, or
the lambs with whom she skipped in the meadows,
were not more gay or happy than was the old inn-keeper’s
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
bright darling child, when like the serpent in
Paradise, Crayford came. He found the honest old
couple and the artless Effie of the very sort whom his
cunning could most easily dupe, and with skill which
would not have disgraced a demon, set about his fiendish
work—for most cogent reasons of his own disguising
his name under that of Belmont, while his worthy coadjutor
assumed that of Jervis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feigning to be charmed with the locality of this little
town, they made known their intention of passing
several weeks in its vicinity. But why enter into the
details of a plot such as should call down the avenging
bolt of heaven. Suffice it, alas! to say, that sin and
villainy triumphed, and as pure a child as ever the finger
of God rested upon, was enticed from her home, from
her poor old doting grandparents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under a solemn promise of marriage the unfortunate
Effie eloped with her base betrayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon reaching Philadelphia, the form of marriage
was gone through with by a convenient priest, and the
sacrifice of innocence completed. For some months,
but for the memory of the aged couple, in the silent
shades of her native valley, she was as happy as a
young confiding wife could be in the love, nay, adoration
of her husband. The lodgings Crayford rented
were in an obscure part of the city, and furnished most
meagerly for the taste of one accustomed to fashionable
display, yet Effie, who had never seen any thing
more grand than the parson’s parlor at home, thought
even a queen could not be more sumptuously lodged,
and she was very sure could not be more happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor, poor Effie!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This devotion on the part of Crayford continued
while his humor lasted—no longer; nor did one gleam
of pity for the unfortunate girl lead him to wear the
mask only as long as suited his own pleasure. The
heart sickens to dwell upon the anguish of poor Effie,
thus abandoned by one for whom she had sacrificed all—one
so friendless, so forlorn, so young and so beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman with whom she lodged allowed her to
remain under her roof until she had stripped her of the
little she possessed—of her clothing, and the few ornaments
Crayford had given her; then, when no more
was to be gained, she thrust her forth into the streets
to die, or live by a fate worse than death!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! that in a world so fair as this, such things
really are, needing no aid from fancy to portray their
atrociousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All day did the poor girl wander through the busy
crowd, gazing piteously into the faces of the multitude,
and if by chance one more kindly than others bent an
eye upon her, she would ask them for Belmont. But
no one could tell her aught. And then night came—dark,
desolate night. On, from street to street passed
the unfortunate, shrinking from the rude stare, and still
ruder speech of brutes calling themselves men; no one
offering a shelter to the houseless wanderer, and even
her own sex meeting her appeals with coarse, unfeeling
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blame her not, that suddenly yielding to the despair
of her young heart, she sought in death relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was near the hour of midnight when she found
herself upon one of the wharves. Dark and cold
stretched the river before her; dark and cold was to
her the world she was leaving. For a moment she
paused, and gazed despairingly around her; tears
trickled down her pallid cheeks, for she felt she was
young to die; and she wept still more when she thought
upon her aged grandparents, who would never know
her sad fate. Then arose before her, floating as it
were upon the heaving mass of waters, on which her
eyes were fixed, that peaceful valley, with the green
hills sweeping around it, and the rustic dwellings of
her playmates and friends looking out upon her beseechingly
from their pleasant shades as she stood
there in her loneliness; and as a far-off symphony of
sweet sounds came floating by, the glad voices which
Nature had sang to her in childhood. Poor Effie Day!
what pleasant memories were crowded into those few
brief moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belmont!” she shrieked, suddenly starting from
that far-off dream, “Belmont, may God forgive you
the deed I am about to do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then falling on her knees, she clasped her trembling
hands, murmuring a prayer for pardon and mercy.
Now casting one long, shuddering look upon the cold,
dark river, she was about to plunge therein, when a
strong arm was thrown around her, and she was
forcibly drawn back several feet from the verge on
which she had stood poised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretched girl, what would you do!” said a voice
in her ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard no more, for a faintness came over her,
and but for the arm still around her, she would have
fallen insensible to the ground. When she recovered,
she found herself upon a bed in a small, neat apartment.
A woman of mild countenance was leaning
over her, chafing her hands and temples, and at the
foot of the bed stood a gentleman dressed in deep mourning,
with his full, dark eyes fixed upon her with pity
and kindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor child!” she heard the woman say, just as she
opened her eyes; “I’ll warrant some of those gay
gallants have broken her heart! Bless her, she is
coming to—there, there darling, how does thee feel
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But ere poor Effie could reply, the gentleman placed
his finger on his lips, as if to caution her from speaking,
then preparing some soothing anodyne, he bade the
woman administer it as quickly as possible, and promising
to be back at an early hour in the morning, took
leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the morning came, however, the unfortunate
girl was raving in all the delirium of fever, which for
weeks baffled medical skill. Youth at length triumphed
over disease, and she was once more able to leave her
bed. During this time she had made known at intervals,
her sad history to the good woman of the house,
and the benevolent stranger who had snatched her
from a watery grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every where the latter sought to discover the perfidious
Belmont, and on pursuing his inquiries for the
grandparents of the wretched girl, he learned that grief
at the desertion of their child, had broken the old people’s
hearts; first the father, then the mother, had
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
been borne to their long homes. A distant relative had
seized upon the little homestead, and already a flaunting
sign usurped the head of good old Penn, which for
more than half a century had smiled benignly down
upon travelers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Effie begged to remain with Mrs. Wing, who kept a
small thread and needle store in —— Lane, near the
river; and the kind woman felt so much pity for her
lonely, unprotected situation, that she readily granted
her request. She was soon able to assist in the labors
of the shop, and to make herself in many ways useful.
Of the kind stranger she saw but little, but from Mrs.
Wing she learned that he had generously defrayed all
the expenses of her illness. He came but seldom, but
when he did, he spoke to her so kindly, encouraged
her with so much gentleness, soothing her sorrows, and
leading her mind to that Higher source where alone
she might look for comfort, that Effie regarded him in
the light of a superior being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus months rolled on, and no tidings of Belmont
reached Effie. One morning, as she stood arranging a
few fancy articles upon the broad window-seat in a
manner which might display their beauty to the best
advantage, she threw up the sash for a moment to inhale
the fine breeze which came sweeping up from the
river. The day was lovely. The gentle undulating
surface of the Delaware, cleft by a hundred flashing
oars, with the keels of many noble vessels buried in
her sparkling tide, their white sails swelling to the
breeze, stretched before her in beauty, while above,
cloudless and serene was the blue vault of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pleasure yacht had just neared the wharf, and from
it a party of gentlemen sprung to land, and with rather
boisterous mirth, crossed the street directly opposite
where Effie still stood at the window. Suddenly her
eyes rested upon one of that gay group, and for a moment
it seemed as if breath and motion were suspended
in the intensity of her gaze. She could not be mistaken—she
knew she was not—it was Belmont, her husband;
and scarcely knowing what she did, she rushed to the
door, and with a wild scream of joy, threw herself
upon the breast of Crayford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, ho, Crayford, you are in luck, my boy!”
shouted one of the party; “by Jove she’s an angel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overwhelmed with confusion, and taken by surprise
at the sudden appearance of one whom he had hoped
never to see more, Crayford for half a minute stood
irresolute, then struggling to disengage himself from
her embrace, he exclaimed angrily,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Off, woman—none of your tricks with me; off,
I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Casting roughly aside those tender arms which clung
to him so despairingly, poor Effie would have fallen to
the ground but for another of the party, who, seizing
her just as she was sinking, cried with mock pathos,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, pretty one, the fellow is a monster; here, I
will take care of you—come, kiss me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Effie sprung from his arms, and clasping the
knees of Crayford as she saw the heartless wretch
moving on,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belmont, my husband!” she cried, in tones of
piercing anguish, “do not, O, do not leave me again;
no, you will not be so cruel—take me with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s cool, by heavens!—ha! ha! ha!” shouted
Crayford, with infernal daring, “you are crazy, child!
I am not your Belmont; perhaps this is he—or this,”
pointing from one to the other of his companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The look of wo with which the poor girl received
this cruel speech, did not escape their notice, and,
hardened as they were, they were moved to pity, and
the rude jests died on their lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Effie rose from her knees, and tottering a step forward,
placed her trembling hand upon the outstretched
arm of Crayford. With an oath he spurned her from
him, when in his path <a id='there2'></a>there suddenly arose one whose
cold, searching glance, struck terror to his guilty soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crayford, I know you!” exclaimed the stranger.
“This, then, is your infernal work; ay, tremble, thou
base destroyer of innocence. Away, I say, ere I am
tempted to do a deed shall shame my manhood!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Livid with rage, Crayford drew a dirk from his
bosom, and rushed suddenly upon the stranger; but in
an instant it was wrenched from his hand, then seizing
the wretch by the collar, as he would a dog, he hurled
him off the curb-stone, and with such force, as sent him
half across the street, and then lifting tenderly the form
of the fainting girl in his arms, bore her into the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader will, of course, infer that Crayford and
the stranger had met before. They had; nor was this
the first dark deed to which the latter knew Crayford
might lay claim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To draw our long digression to a close, suffice it to
say, that it was the unfortunate Effie Day whom
Florence had met while walking with Crayford, and
that the gentleman whom she had pointed out to him
in the picture gallery, was no other than the stranger
of whom we have just spoken, and whose appearance
had so perceptibly agitated her companion.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>We will now return to Florence, whom we left in a
state of such cruel suspense, and it would be difficult to
say, perhaps, which of the two at the moment she
hoped to find the most sincere—Crayford or the unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She felt she had gone too far to recede, and that
it had now become her duty to probe this enigma
thoroughly. Her confidence in Crayford was too much
impaired for her to receive him again into her presence
so long as such doubts hung around his character. “I
will obey the instructions of this unknown Mentor,”
said she, “it cannot be that he is false; no, to this Mrs.
Belmont, then, will I go, and go alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ordering a carriage, therefore, and directing the
driver to No. 7 —— Lane, she set forth upon an errand
which, for a young, unprotected female, was certainly
rather hazardous. Of its locality she had no knowledge;
and when she found herself gradually approaching
the opposite side of the city from her own residence,
passing through narrow streets, and at every turning
drawing nearer to the river, she would have felt more
apprehension but for the words of the unknown:
“Fear not,” urged the note, “one will be near you
who will protect you with his life.” These words reassured
her, for she had so long accustomed herself to
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
regard him in the light of her protector and friend, that
even now, when her doubts almost distracted her, she
still gave herself up to the pleasing thought that he
was near, and no danger could befall her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is No. 7 —— Lane,” said the coachman,
<a id='rein2'></a>reining in his horses before the thread and needle
store of Mrs. Wing, “whom shall I ask for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, I will go in myself,” answered
Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wing was sitting in a little back room, but
seeing a lady enter the shop, arose and came forward
to the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a Mrs. Belmont lodges here?” inquired
Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a young woman of that name in my employ,
friend—would thee like to see her? If thee does,
thee can go to her room—she has been very ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence bowing assent, the good woman led the
way up a narrow staircase, and opened the door of a
neat little chamber, saying, as she motioned Florence
to go in,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a young woman to see thee, Effie,” <a id='with'></a>then immediately
withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the bed, in a large easy-chair, propped up by
pillows, sat poor Effie Day. Not a tinge of the rose,
once blooming so freshly there, could be traced on that
pale cheek, and of the same marble hue were her lips
and brow. These, contrasted by her jet-black hair,
and eyes so large and brilliant, imparted a strange
ghastliness to her appearance. At the first glance
Florence recognized her as the young woman whom
Crayford had pointed out to her as a fortune-teller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This at once opened a new channel for thought, and
supposing, therefore, that she had been directed thither
for the purpose of consulting her art, she said, half
timidly approaching her,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you tell my fortune for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Effie, too, had recognized the lovely girl whom
she had seen walking with him she still believed to be
her husband, and looking up with a sad earnestness of
expression, made answer,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your fortune! O, my beautiful young lady, may it
never be so wretched as mine!” Then noticing the
evident perturbation of Florence’s manner, she continued,
“Can I serve you in any way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sent to you for the purpose, as I suppose, of
having my fortune told,” answered Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is some mistake,” replied Effie, a half smile
flitting over her pale face, “I am not a fortune-teller.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought—I understood—that is—Mr. Crayford
told me you were. Did I not meet you one day
in Chestnut street?” asked Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint color tinged the cheek of Effie, and her beautiful
eyes drooped low as she answered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did—too well do I remember it—you looking
so happy, and I so sad! Yes, I saw you point me out
to Belmont.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Belmont!</span> I know no such person,” said Florence,
“it was Mr. Crayford who was with me—it was Mr.
Crayford who told me you were a fortune-teller.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he—did he tell you so?” said Effie, bursting
into tears, “for, alas! young lady, it was Belmont—it
was my husband you were walking with!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Your husband!</span>” cried Florence, aghast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my husband. Dear young lady, think not I
am mistaken—would that I were! I saw those eyes,
so full of love, fixed on your blushing face—heard the
soft tones of his voice as he bent low to address you.
Yes, I saw all—heard all; and then, ah then!” cried
Effie, with a shudder, and raising her tearful eyes to
heaven, “what a look he cast upon <span class='it'>me</span>! But did he—did
Belmont send you to me?” she eagerly demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he did not—it was another who directed me
here. And now, my poor girl,” said Florence, drawing
her chair close to Effie, and kindly taking her hand, “I
see that you have been cruelly treated—will you then
tell me your history—will you tell me of Crayford, or
Belmont, for I now see they are one and the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you love him?” asked Effie, sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I do not love him, nor is it probable we shall
ever meet again,” replied Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he has sought your love—and yet you love him
not—how strange! <span class='it'>I love him!</span> O, would to God I
did not!” and here the poor girl sobbed aloud, while
Florence, overcome by emotion, threw her arms around
the unfortunate, and resting her head on her bosom,
mingled tears with hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When both were a little more calm, Florence again
urged her to reveal her sorrows, which Effie did in
language so simple and earnest as carried conviction
to the mind of her listener, who shuddered as the fearful
abyss in which she had been so nearly lost, thus opened
before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you know the name of the person who has
been so kind to you?” asked Florence, referring to the
preserver of Effie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not,” answered Effie, “neither does Mrs.
Wing, but to me, dear young lady, he has been an
angel of goodness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange!” thought Florence, “this benevolent
stranger can surely be no other than my unknown
friend. He is, then, all I first imagined him—kind,
noble, disinterested—and yet I have doubted him; how
am I reproved! but for him, my own fate might, perhaps,
have resembled that of the unfortunate girl before
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While lost in these reflections, she was suddenly
startled by a slight scream from Effie, who, grasping
her arm tightly, said, while her pale face crimsoned,
and her bosom heaved tumultuously,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark! <span class='it'>his</span> voice—it <span class='it'>is</span> his voice!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose voice—what is the matter?” demanded
Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not know,” continued Effie, as half rising
she bent her little head, and raised her finger in an attitude
of deep attention, “Do you not know Belmont’s
voice? Ah, I see now very well you do not love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belmont! good heavens, what shall I do!” exclaimed
Florence, starting up, “is there no way for
me to escape—not for worlds would I have him find
me here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go in there,” said Effie, pointing to a small door;
“but you will be obliged to remain there—there is no
other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must, of course, hear all you say,” said
Florence, shrinking instinctively from thus intruding
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
upon the young girl’s privacy. Effie looked up confidently
and answered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well; if this meeting is to restore me my happiness,
you will rejoice with me; if it plunge me in still
greater wo, then, dear lady, it is better for you to
know it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence had no time to reply, for now a man’s step
was heard quickly ascending the stairs. Springing
into the little room adjoining, she closed the door, and
panting with agitation, awaited the result. Again the
words of the unknown recurred to her, “Fear not!
one will be near you, who will protect you with his
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scarcely had Florence withdrawn, when the other
door was opened, and a man wearing a cloak, with his
hat drawn far down over his face, entered, then closing
it, and carefully turning the key, he advanced toward
Effie, who had risen, and stood clinging to the easy-chair
to support her trembling limbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are surprised to see me, I suppose, child,” said
he, throwing off his cloak and hat, and revealing the
form and features of Crayford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear husband, do we then meet again!” cried
Effie, feebly extending her arms, as she sunk back into
the chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crayford folded his arms across his breast, and
throwing himself carelessly upon a seat, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come to settle matters with you, that’s all.
What the d——l are you doing here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t speak so cruelly to me—don’t, Belmont!”
cried poor Effie, bursting into tears. “O, if you knew
the anguish I have endured since you left me; if you
knew, that, driven to despair, I even sought to take my
own life, you would pity me! If you knew how I have
watched for you—sought for you—how I have waited
for you, you would at least have compassion on me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a fool!” exclaimed Crayford, brutally.
“Why I thought you would have learned better by this
time; but since you have not, why you must not be in
my way, that’s all. Now listen to me; you must go
out of the city—and look you, on condition that you
will never come back again, I will give you a thousand
dollars; come, that’s generous, now—most men would
let you go to the —— before they would do as much
for you. The fact is, child, I am going to be married,
and to a beautiful, rich lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Married!</span>” shrieked Effie, starting to her feet, and
catching his arm, “married—am I not your wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! ha! ha!—come, that’s a good one; not exactly,
child, you are only my wife, <span class='it'>pour passer le
<a id='temps'></a>temps</span>, as the French say. No, that was all a hoax—you
are free, and with a thousand dollars to buy you a
husband! Now is not that better?” said Crayford,
chucking her under the chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Effie did not reply. It needed not—those eyes, more
eloquent than words, fastened upon his guilty countenance,
told plainly a villain’s work of wo wrought in
her young, trusting heart. Crayford, hardened as he
was, quailed under their reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length she spoke, but there was an unnatural
calmness in her voice,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is the lady you will marry?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I will tell you—and, by the way, you came
near ruining my prospects there. She saw you in
Chestnut street one day, as we were walking, and you
looked so —— queer at me, that, faith, I were put to my
trumps, and mumbled over something about your being
a crazy fortune-teller—was not that well done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>was</span> well done,” answered Effie, in the same
tone; “but her name—tell me her name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her name is May—a young, pretty widow; though,
on my soul, Effie—why I declare, now I look at you,
you are almost as handsome as ever; if it was not for
her money, she might look further for a husband.
But come, I am in a hurry; I want you to sign this
paper, pledging yourself to leave the city never to return,
upon which condition I also pledge myself to give
you a thousand dollars—will you sign it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” answered Effie; “but I require a witness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A witness—nonsense! well, bring up the old woman,
then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not necessary—here is one,” said Effie, advancing
with a firm step to the inner door, and throwing
it wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Severe in youthful beauty,” Florence came forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had a thunderbolt suddenly fallen from heaven,
Crayford could not have been more paralyzed. Florence
paused upon the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go!” said she, waving her hand, “go, Mr. Crayford,
this innocent girl is under my protection. I have
heard all—I know all—begone, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, incapable of uttering one word, the guilty
wretch, awed by the majesty of virtue, stole away as
a fiend from the presence of an angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The over-tasked firmness of poor Effie now gave
way; and piteous it was to witness the agony of her
grief and shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor, unhappy child!” cried Florence, taking her
to her bosom, and tenderly soothing her, “you have
been basely, cruelly dealt with! Heavens! I shudder
when I think what my fate might have been but for
this discovery!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She remained some hours with the wretched girl,
nor left her until she had become more tranquil, when,
with the assurance that she would see her again in a
very few days, she took an affectionate leave of poor
Effie Day, and returned home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will state here that the mysterious friend of Florence
May knew nothing of Crayford’s visit to the
victim of his wiles. He merely intended that from the
lips of Effie, she might learn his baseness. Her meeting
with Crayford, therefore, was one of those singular
coincidences which often startle even the most skeptical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence returned home with feelings difficult to
analyze. The interest with which the unknown had
from the first inspired her, now suddenly acquired new
strength. She had proved him to be the friend he professed,
while his kindness to the unfortunate Effie (for
she doubted not his individuality) was another proof
of his excellence, showing that his goodness of heart
did not confine itself alone to her welfare, which might
be attributable, perhaps, to his avowed attachment, but
could find its way to succor where’er distress or
wretchedness dwelt. She felt this love and kindness
merited return—and her heart timidly awarded it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
Selecting a beautiful emerald ring from her jewels,
she enclosed it with the following note:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Generous, noble friend, I have proved your assertions
true. O, pardon my doubts! You have said you
love me; will you then deem it bold in me if I acknowledge
the interest with which you have inspired
me. Yet you say we may never meet; why is this?
Accept the enclosed, and with it the gratitude of
Florence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You then acknowledge an interest in me,” wrote
the unknown, in reply. “Thanks, a thousand thanks.
The time approaches when the barrier now existing
may be removed, and then I may hope to win your
love! Where, now, are those despairing thoughts
which crushed me with their weight of wo; one kind
word from you, and as the soft moonbeams dispel the
blackness of night, they have fled, and around me is the
light of joy—hope—happiness.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Ten months a widow—was there ever such folly!</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be sure, much might be done in two more, if one
earnestly set about it—for Florence had a pair of eyes,
and a tongue might “call an angel down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet to those about her, she seemed more reckless of
her fate than ever—going out but seldom, and scarcely
allowing any gentleman to approach her presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old housekeeper, who was strongly attached to
her young mistress, had fretted and scolded to herself
for weeks and months. The only time when she
managed to preserve her equanimity, was when Crayford
visited the house, for then she saw plainly an offer
of marriage, and a wedding-party in the bottom of her
tea-cup, while love-letters and kisses sparkled in the
candle! But when, like all others, he was also dismissed,
the poor soul could contain herself no longer,
but breaking in abruptly upon Florence one morning,
she thus began:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does thee know what month it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear Mrs. Hicks,” answered Florence, raising
her eyes from her painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does thee know that in two more thee has
been a widow one year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, yes! but why—why, Mrs. Hicks, do you remind
me of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly, child—has thee forgotten thee must marry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Must</span> marry! O no, my good friend, not unless I
please—and it is not my will to marry,” said Florence,
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not thy will to marry!” exclaimed Mrs. Hicks,
lifting up both hands; “and so thy will is to be
poor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Florence, “if you call it being
poor to be possessed of health and strength, added to
three hundred dollars a year. <span class='it'>Poor!</span> why my dear
Mrs. Hicks, I shall be rich—really rich!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rich! Ah, thee talks like a simple child! What
will thee do with thy health and strength and three
hundred dollars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, much,” replied Florence. “With two hundred
I can hire a neat little house—with the other I can furnish
it comfortably, and with my health and strength I
can teach music and painting; and, if you please, dear
Mrs. Hicks, you shall live with me, and so shall poor
Effie Day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child, thee knows nothing of life,” cried the good
woman, wiping her eyes. “Verily, it makes my heart
sad to see thee blindly throwing from thee the fortune
that good old Abel May did give thee! Child, thee does
not act in accordance with the wishes of that good
man; for, truly, he did beseech thee to marry, that
thee might retain the good gifts of the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence threw her arms around the neck of the old
lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, dear Mrs. Hicks, for I know you mean
all you have said for my good; but not to possess millions
could I be tempted to barter my affections; and
even if I loved, I would not marry within the prescribed
year, when by remaining a widow, I can give
to the relations of that excellent man, the fortune to
which I have no claim, save in his kindness for one unfortunate.
Could I have done so, I would long since
have yielded up my rights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thee is a noble, good girl; and so long as these
hands can work, they shall work for thee; but I am
sorry, nevertheless, to see thee giving up to the lovers
of Mammon what they have so long coveted. Verily
it grieves me, too, that young Abel May does not return!
Ah, child, child, I hope thee may never be
sorry!” and affectionately kissing her young lady, Mrs.
Hicks went back to her work, half pleased, half angry
with the determination of Florence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, slowly, slowly, slowly, to the
kindred of old Abel May, circled the twelve months,
dating from the day of his death; suspiciously, anxiously,
uneasily watching every movement of the young
widow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But joy, joy! The long looked-for morning at length
dawned. To their eager gaze the sun seemed like a
huge golden guinea, as he smiled from the eastern sky
upon their hopes, and soft and silky as bank-note
paper appeared the thin, vapory clouds floating o’er
his path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again from marble-columned squares and by-lanes,
from suburban cottages and distant villages they came,
flocking in like vultures, all ready to pounce down upon
the innocent little lamb whom old Abel May had
sheltered in his bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor were their torments ended here; even then a
new fear seized upon them. Who knows what desperation
might effect; the widow that very day might
take it into her head to marry—they had no doubt she
would.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! each hour marking the twelve of that day of
doom, was but a type of the preceding twelve month,
which had finally brought around the <span class='it'>joyful</span> anniversary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Midnight sounded. Hurra! hurra! The widow
unmarried; and bright, sparkling dollars, like shooting
stars, falling around them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At twelve, M. precisely, the lawyers bowed
themselves into the spacious parlor of the deceased,
for it could no longer be called the widow’s, in order
to read again the last will and testament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Triumph sat again upon the countenances of those
whom the occasion had called together, although some
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
made most woful faces in trying to squeeze out a few
tears, thinking it would be judicious to consider the
old man as just dead. But Florence was as provokingly
cheerful and handsome as ever—why one would
have thought she was about to receive a fortune instead
of losing one; and it even seemed as if she could
hardly suppress her laughter as she glanced around at
the expectant heirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man of law at length drew forth the will with
an emphatic “<span class='it'>Hem</span>,” premonitory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then on all sides there was a general stir; the gentlemen
pulled up their shirt-collars and elongated their
faces; the ladies smoothed down their mourning robes
and held their handkerchiefs ready to receive a tear
when occasion should call it forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reading commenced, and all eyes turned exultingly
upon Florence as these words sounded audibly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To my beloved wife, Florence, I do bequeath all my
property, both personal and real, consisting of,” etc.,
etc., “provided that within one year from the day of
my death she marries. But if, at the expiration of that
time she still remain a widow, then I do annul my will
in her favor, and do bequeath the same to my nephew,
Abel May, provided he returns within the said year.
If not, then unto those who can bring good proofs of
their consanguinity to me, do I direct my property to
be equally distributed. Always excepting an annuity
of three hundred dollars, to be paid to my beloved wife,
so long as she lives, etc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three hundred dollars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An old fool!” echoed softly from lip to lip—the
paltry sum already dashing their cup of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have heard the will, ladies and gentlemen,”
said the lawyer, addressing the company, “I believe
Mrs. May acknowledges herself still a widow—will
you signify the same, madam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You observe, ladies and gentlemen, the lady admits
herself a widow; then, of course, it only remains for
me to announce young Abel May as sole heir to
all the property, both personal and real, of which the
testator died possessed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Abel May has not returned!” was the general
exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Abel May has returned—Abel May is here to
claim his rights!” said the lawyer, screech owl that he
was to their ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The folding doors were thrown open, and a gentleman
slowly advanced within the circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did Florence dream—was it no vision of her imagination!
for as she looked upon the stranger, the same
eyes she had seen so mournfully gazing upon her in
the picture gallery, but which now, beaming with happiness,
met hers, while upon his finger—a star of hope—glittered
the emerald ring she had sent the unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slightly bowing to the astonished assembly, Abel
May eagerly approached her. The happy girl looked
up with a sweet smile as he drew near; what need of
words, her beautiful eyes were far more eloquent, and
with thrilling joy the young heir caught her to his
bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the discomfited relatives disputed the identity
of the tall, elegant stranger, with the lad who so many
years before went roving; but his proofs were indisputable.
So out of the room, and out of the house, and
back again to their homes, with unreplenished purses,
they quickly dispersed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It appears that young May returned only a few
weeks subsequent to the death of his uncle from the
East Indies, where he had accumulated a handsome
fortune. By accident he saw Florence, and was
deeply interested by her appearance. Aware that a
lapse of so many years must have materially altered his
person, he resolved to remain incognito. Frequent
opportunities of seeing the young widow ripened the
interest she had first inspired into affection. Yet he
would not present himself to her notice amid the throng
of fortune-hunters and idle flatterers who surrounded
her. Rumor had made known to him the nature of
the will, and he resolved to abide the year, taking upon
himself, meanwhile, the pleasing office of acting as the
protector and guide of the young, inexperienced widow.
If, at the end of the year, she had so far evinced a soul
above all sordid views as to remain unmarried, then,
and not till then, would he seek to gain her love. With
the fortune, however, which, in the event of her remaining
single, would fall to him, he nobly resolved to
have no share, and had therefore drawn up an instrument
by which he relinquished all claim in favor of
Florence, whether successful in obtaining her affection
or not. This only awaited its proper time to be
duly attested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year and a day brought results with which the
reader is already acquainted, and a few weeks witnessed
the happy union of Florence and young Abel
May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the roof of her benefactor and his lovely wife,
the unfortunate Effie Day found a home and kind
friends. Of Crayford nothing more was ever heard.
It was supposed he had left the country for a field less
obnoxious to the display of his peculiar attributes.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Major Anspach was an old gentleman who was as
thin as he was long, nay, even thinner than he was
long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forty years before the epoch when occurred, oh
reader, the events we shall take the liberty to recount
to you, the worthy major was the finest looking musqueteer
in the regiment of Monsieur d’Artois. He
possessed some fortune, belonged to one of the best
families in Lorraine, could fence to admiration, and
had a heart at the service of the fair sex. The ladies
of the court and city, to whom a son of Mars is always
irresistible, of course were not insensible to the attractions
of a musqueteer of five feet eleven, and the major,
on his part, was so gallant in his attentions to them,
that his captain gave him the title of the Turenne of
boudoirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But forty years leave some traces of their flight;
Major Anspach in 1827 was the mere shadow of his
former self, and retained of his vanished splendors
only a scanty income of 800 livres, a pair of black
plush pantaloons, a long snuff-colored overcoat, and a
garret for which he paid forty crowns a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding this serious diminution of the
means of happiness, the major, who was a widower,
contrived to enjoy himself perfectly for at least six
months in the year. How few persons do we see
who can boast of being satisfied with their destiny one
day out of two?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true that the moderate pleasures of Major Anspach
did not materially encroach on his pocket, and
for this we deem the cidevant musqueteer worthy of
eulogium. He limited his enjoyments to a promenade
in the Tuileries, each time that the sun deigned to
shine on its precincts, happy alike when the Dog Star
raged or under the frozen beams of a wintry sky. As
this orb however rarely deigns to show us his face in
unclouded brilliance, our old friend had made it his
profound study to discover that part of the garden in
which he could enjoy the rays of Phœbus without exposure
to their intensity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After much research and divers trials, the major at
last made his choice. At the extremity of the terrace
des Feuillants is a platform, embowered in trees and
shrubs, which commands a view of the Place de la
Concorde, and the architectural entrance to that part
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
of the garden. A balustrade terminates this platform,
and by a graceful sweep conducts you to a pleasant
enclosure between the avenues and the western gate
of the Tuileries. This turn in the balustrade forms
then, as you will perceive, an acute angle with the
line of the platform, and it is of the summit of this
angle, whose sides are composed of two walls about
twelve feet high, which form a fortified corner, that
we are going to speak. Exposed to the rising sun,
this spot (as the reader may ascertain for himself if he
likes) seems expressly constructed in order to concentrate
the greatest possible heat in the smallest space,
which heat would indeed be insupportable were it not
surrounded with flowering shrubs and thickets to render
it agreeable to the frequenters of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Anspach, for reasons pertaining a little to his
plush inexpressibles, avoided all contact with the passing
crowd; and although gazing with pleasure on the
sports of the children who visited the garden, nothing
would have annoyed him more than too close a proximity
to the young rogues, or to the fresh and frisky
damsels with laughing eyes who had charge of the
juveniles. It was essential to his comfort, therefore,
to select a position where he could see without being
seen, and also that his seat should be of such narrow
limits that when he once occupied it, no one could
expect to share it with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This bench M. Anspach had at last discovered at
the intersection of the balustrade and platform, between
two hedges of woodbine and honeysuckle, shaded by
the foliage of a noble tree, and fragrant with roses and
jasmine. He could there bask in the morning sun,
enjoy a refreshing breeze at noon, and in the evening
luxuriate in the perfume exhaled from the flowers and
shrubs. The place, however, was so narrow, and so
completely buried in the surrounding foliage that,
although, as we have before insinuated, our friend was
the longest and thinnest of majors, he could not, without
some trouble, ensconce himself within its limits,
but, once seated, his angular figure so completely coincided
with the geometrical accidences of the bench,
that it was impossible for even a fly to find a resting-place
beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Established in his daily position, the view of the
dazzling façade of the royal palace through the grove
of venerable chestnut trees, would plunge the old man
in retrospection of the gay scenes in which he had
once been an actor, and it was these melancholy
though pleasing reminiscences of the past, combined
with the murmur of the lively crowd and the mingled
perfume and beauty of the flowers and foliage, that
rendered this spot a <a id='ter'></a>terrestrial paradise to the cidevant
musqueteer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And how does it happen, you ask, that this poor
Major Anspach, who was really a gentleman and
courtier at Versailles forty years ago, should now be
reduced to seek a refuge from the sun, and from the
inquisitive gaze that might have too closely peered
into the mystery of his plush inexpressibles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was by one of those simple, <a id='unfore'></a>unforeseen accidents,
on which sometimes hangs the destiny of a life-time,
and which, in the major’s case, occurred in this wise:
One evening a celebrated belle, Mademoiselle Guimard,
was so awkward as to drop her handkerchief; the
consequence of which was that her friend fell from
one trouble into another, until Fate landed him in his
long snuff-colored overcoat and plush pantaloons on
the bench which is the true subject of this remarkable
history.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Mademoiselle Guimard having dropped her handkerchief,
of the finest linen cambric, edged with Malines
lace, and apparently embroidered by the hands of
fairies, the Chevalier de Palissandre, an arrant fop,
clothed in velvet, and an expert swordsman, conceived
the impertinent idea of stooping to pick it up; but he
did it so clumsily that he trod on the toe of Major
Anspach, who was just then offering his arm to the
lady—how inexcusable! Briefly they exchanged
glances—bowed most politely—and the next morning
went out to cut each other’s throats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At day-break M. Anspach had his hair dressed, and
attiring himself in the most elegant manner, drove in
his carriage to the Porte Maillot, which was the place
of rendezvous. He put 300,000 francs in gold in his
carriage, that he might immediately leave the country
for foreign lands, until the family of the chevalier had
ceased to mourn his death, for you must know that the
major had a certain trick in fencing that he considered
sure, so that according to his belief the chevalier was
as good as dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing succeeded as he had foreseen; they made
some passes, and as soon as the major perceived that
the chevalier was getting excited, he made such a
furious thrust en tierce that M. Palissandre saw the
flash and fell struck by the thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hardly daylight, and M. Anspach was in such
a hurry to get in his carriage that he made a mistake,
and entering that of the chevalier, was many leagues
distant ere he discovered his error, and it was then
too late to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arrived at London, he remembered that his banker
could tell him what had become of his carriage, his
300,000 francs and the Chevalier de Palissandre. He
wrote to him then, and took advantage of the opportunity
to ask him to send funds, for after turning his
pockets inside out he had only found a few Louis. He
had to wait some time for an answer, and in promenading
the Park to beguile the weary moments he fell
in love with a young Creole from the Spanish West
Indies. The lady was on the point of embarking for
Havana, and as our heedless hero could not become
accustomed to the climate nor the plum-pudding, he
raised a thousand crowns on some diamonds he had
with him, and borrowed a thousand Louis from a
friend attached to the French embassy, whom he had
fortunately encountered in the street; the next morning
he embarked on the same vessel as the young
Creole, and was on his way to the West Indies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After arriving at the Havana he wrote again to his
banker, asking anew for his carriage and the chevalier,
and demanding money. But the vessel that carried
his dispatches was apparently lost, for six months
afterward, the major had spent his last doubloon, and
was still expecting an answer from his agent; he was
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
also terribly tired of his love affair. In this emergency
he thought the best means to obtain information was
to seek it in person, even at the risk of being arrested
as a deserter from his regiment; he resolved, however,
to be prudent, and to enter Paris incognito. He
sold his <a id='ward'></a>wardrobe to pay for his passage, and landed
without any misfortune, assuming the first name that
occurred to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His friends who recognized him gave him a warm
welcome, and informed him that his banker had left
for America, carrying with him 500,000 francs, the
price of an estate the major had sold the year previous.
This new accident entirely disturbed his equanimity,
as the above sum, with that lost in the carriage, comprised
nearly all his fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no resource but in the chevalier, but the
chevalier he was told, after being an invalid for two
weeks, had as soon as he was able to leave his bed
started for London. The major, who inferred that the
chevalier was anxious to return him his sword cut and
his money, was touched even to tears by this generosity,
and the next morning embarked for London in
pursuit of his magnanimous foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arrived at the great English metropolis, he ran to
the embassy, visited all the hotels, explored Covent
Garden and the Opera, searched the gambling-houses,
the fencing-rooms, the coffee-houses—no chevalier!
Finally he discovered by application to the firm of
Ashburton &amp; Co., bankers in the city, that the chevalier
had departed three months before to the Havana.
“Oh, the devil!” cried the disappointed major, “how
cruel is Fortune. I would not return within reach of
the claws of my Creole for all the treasures of the
East. I will go to America and horsewhip that rascally
banker—that will amuse me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was certainly his most obvious course of proceeding,
for as he had nothing left but a small income
from a farm in the environs of Phalsbourg, it was
better to run after 500,000 francs than 100,000 crowns.
He therefore embarked for New Orleans, where his
banker had sought refuge, and he succeeded in finding
him, already penniless from speculating in public
lands. The major felt the less remorse for cudgeling
him soundly, and then not knowing what else to do,
enrolled himself in the corps of M. Lafayette, to fight
the English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He evinced great bravery, and his career would
doubtless have been brilliant had it not been for his
unfortunate rencontre with M. de Palissandre, which,
by rendering him a deserter, made him amenable at
any time to the requisition of the Provost of Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American war terminated; the major found
himself tolerably indebted to some generous friends
who had divined his uncomfortable position. This
circumstance recalled the missing carriage, money,
and chevalier to his memory, and he accordingly wrote
to the Havana for precise information. But the reply
was that no one could be found answering the description
of M. de Palissandre, and it was therefore probable
he had died on the voyage out. The major
almost resolved to hang himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other side, the payments from his farm had
not reached him for some months, and the new aspect
of affairs in 1789 did not inspire him with the desire of
going in person to receive his arrears and to learn the
cause of their non arrival, he could indeed nearly
guess it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His situation could not be more embarrassing, all
things conspired to overwhelm him. “Is there not
something incredible,” said he, one evening when
seated on the Battery at New York, and in his excitement
unconsciously speaking aloud, “is there not
something incredible in my being the sport of such a
destiny: that I should have been gallanting Mademoiselle
Guimard, when the coquette dropped her
handkerchief, and cost me a hundred thousand pounds,
without mentioning my scrape with the government at
Paris, and my debts that I cannot pay? Oh Fate!
who can avert thy blows!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Friend,” said the new comer, “you appear overwhelmed
with trouble. What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will tell you, sir, what you can do,” said the
major, haughtily drawing himself up; “you can take
off your hat when you address me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” replied the unknown, with a calm
smile, removing his hat, “an honest man respects
misfortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not my misfortunes, sir, but myself I insist on
your respecting, when you do me the honor to speak
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are French, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Frenchman and a nobleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you say, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say you cannot be a French nobleman, since
there are no more noblemen in France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not if there be any in France, but there is
one here who will make you food for fishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that for a challenge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merely as advice. You are the cidevant Baron
Anspach, of Phalsbourg, and you descend by the
female line from the last Dukes of Lorraine. I know
that, and I know also that your farm near Phalsbourg
has been confiscated, because you emigrated; that you
have no funds in France, and that you are there condemned
to death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am obliged to you for the information, but I see
nothing in it to prevent my pitching you into the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be right, sir; but even should you drown
me, I do not perceive how it will improve your affairs.
You will only have one friend less, and very certainly
one misfortune more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It appears, sir, that you have pretensions to wit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know which of us two has the most, sir;
I, who would enlighten you on your situation, or you
who would throw me into the river for offering you
my assistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am your debtor, sir, but a gentleman descended
from the last Dukes of Lorraine cannot accept the
offers of a stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And from whom can you expect them here, if not
from a stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
“Permit me to inform you, sir, that no gentleman is
reduced to humiliation who retains his sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how would you use it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To chastise the scoundrel who would insult me
with his importunate pity, and then, rather than expose
myself to repeated injury, thrust it through my
own body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak proudly; but acknowledge that you
can do better than thus to insult God by disposing of
the life of your fellow being and yourself. Are you
sure there is no resource left you but suicide?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I have six Louis left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better than that, Major Anspach; there is a treasure
in your reach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you mean wisdom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but something that leads to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Labor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you are a moral reformer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am but an humble creature of God, major, whose
consciousness of his fallibility has led him to pursue
the useful conjoined to the good. But I have only
discovered one resource that is alike beneficial to mind
and body, to the one in this world, to the other in
eternity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this thing,” said M. Anspach thoughtfully,
“is labor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, labor—man’s destiny since his creation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man—well, <span class='it'>you</span> are right, for being no longer a
baron I am but a man. But what is your motive in
this conversation? You have catechised me for an
hour, as if I recognized your right to annoy me. Remember,
sir, I do not even know your name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the devil! take care; you shall not give me
the lie twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the unknown, smiling, “I am going
to commit the offence for the third time, in repeating
that you cannot be ignorant of my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faith, sir, if you think your name of any importance,
I do not prevent your telling it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my intention to have done so just now,
when I offered you my hand and my services. My
name is Franklin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Franklin! Ah, sir, what have I done! Can you
ever pardon me? I throw myself at your feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Franklin raised the major, laughing till the tears
came into his eyes, and telling him that it was not the
great man he imagined, as that luminary had ceased
to enlighten the world two years before, but for want
of a better he, George Steward Zachariah Franklin,
of the firm of Franklin &amp; Son, of New York, was at
his service, and ready to give proofs of his identity to
his worthy friend M. Anspach. He further explained,
that it was on the recommendation of Lafayette himself,
that he had sought him out; the latter on leaving
America having related the major’s situation and adventures
to him, and commended him to his attention.
He added that if the major would do him the honor to
dine with him, he would have the pleasure of submitting
some propositions to him worthy of consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Anspach, Baron of Phalsbourg, extended his
hand to Mr. Franklin, and pledged himself to profit for
the future by the lesson of wisdom so opportunely received.
The banker pursued his advantage so well
that three days later the major left for Canada, and
three months afterward was superintending the labors
of five hundred colonists, who, under his orders,
cleared a forest of some eight square leagues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Anspach lived happily in these solitudes for
twenty-five years, laboring to introduce civilization
into their savage recesses. It was a rude apprenticeship
for the cidevant courtier, but it is due to truth to
declare that as his fortune increased, the major had
the good sense to forget, for the moment at least, that
he was descended on the female side from the last
Dukes of Lorraine, and having married the daughter
of a rich farmer, he thanked Providence, whose inscrutable
ways had led him to true happiness at more
than 1500 leagues from the Opera. Unfortunately the
major’s wife died after a brief illness, leaving no children,
and the day after her death he received letters
from France, apprising him of the return of the Bourbons.
The devil then put it into his head to remember
his barony of Phalsbourg and his regiment. He
immediately sold his American property, realized his
whole fortune, which was more than a million of dollars,
and embarked on board the Neptune for Havre.
The voyage was prosperous until within sight of the
coast of Brittany, when a sudden tempest arose, drove
the vessel on shore and completely wrecked her.
Some passengers were saved, among whom was the
major, who landed on the shores of France as poor as
he had left them thirty years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only hope left to him after this disaster was,
that he should be favorably received at court; and
although his views were, in many respects, much
changed, he resolved nevertheless to present himself
to the king, in whose guards he had formerly served.
But, from his first appearance, he saw there was no
room for delusive expectations. In fact the major was
not what was then termed “a nobleman broken down
by exile,” he had dared to be happy while monarchy
suffered, and to enrich himself among republicans,
while other men of quality were forced to ask credit
from the butchers of Coblentz. They did not even
take into account his recent misery, since it was owing
to a fortuitous accident, and he was therefore coldly
dismissed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The major was too proud of his maternal descent to
abase himself by servility. He sturdily turned his
back on the Tuileries, and concentrated all his efforts
toward reëstablishing himself in his farm at Phalsbourg.
He partly succeeded in his object, but when
he had paid the advocates, the solicitors, the bailiffs,
and the court fees; when he had discharged the debts
he owed to some old friends, he found himself the
possessor of 800 francs a year and an extremely philosophical
wardrobe. He did not complain, but resigned
himself to the dictates of necessity; he reduced
his desires to the compass of his means, his ambition
vanished, his contentment increased, and the man of
the American forests, the colonist, reappeared more
worthy of esteem in the midst of poverty than when
he was rich and powerful in those vast solitudes.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
And this brings us back, dear reader, to the little
bench so prettily hidden in the clustering jasmine and
roses, last retreat, last enjoyment of the cidevant musqueteer,
who ruined himself twice and became a sage
because Mademoiselle Guimard dropped her handkerchief.</p>

<div><h1><a id='homew'></a>HOMEWOOD.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY P. C. SHANNON.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the many beautiful country-seats which
have, of late years, sprung up around us, there is no
one perhaps that in architectural design, in compactness
and elegance of finish, surpasses “Homewood,”
the residence of the Hon. William Wilkins. Throughout
all its parts, and in all its arrangements, it presents
a chaste and highly tasteful appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name adopted is quite appropriate. The building
stands in the centre of a nearly circular area, the
circumference of which is bounded for acres back by
the tall oaks of the primeval forest. In the summer,
when the grass waves and the flowers unfold their
fragrant treasures, this circular area presents to the
eye the aspect of an island of verdure surrounded by
the dim old trees. When evening approaches and the
sun pours his slanting beams through the luxuriant
foliage, bathing the boughs in liquid gold, no place can
be more delightful than the “columned porch” at
Homewood. The warbling of the birds, the fragrance
of manifold flowers, the lowing of distant herds, the
gentle rustling of the branches moved by the passing
breeze, the shouts of the distant harvestmen preparing
to leave, with the sun’s decline, their daily toil—all
combine to lull the heart and to enchant the senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The approach is through a spacious avenue, curving
as it nears the building, and crossing a little dingle,
through which murmurs a gentle streamlet. The
scenery is lovely, the soil fertile, the location airy and
healthful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole country around abounds in historic associations
of the “olden time,” when the red man struggled
against the advancing column of civilization.
And what history has been unable rightfully to appropriate,
legend and fiction have gathered up, and woven
into dark and solemn drapery, wherewith they have
clothed every prominent locality and invested every
heroic character of those shadowy ages. Over these
fields once roamed the Shawanese, who, driven from
Florida, made their way to the head of the Ohio—a
powerful, warlike, and restless tribe, who alone of all
the Indians retained a tradition that their fathers had
crossed the ocean. Not far off dwelt, for a time, a
branch of the Lenni Lenape, who, in former days, had
welcomed the Shawanese to their hunting-grounds.
Tradition has it, that afterward the last mentioned
tribe, forgetful of former kindness and hospitality, left
their homes on the Ohio, crossed the Allegheny Mountains
and fell by night upon the camps of the unsuspecting
Lenape on the river Juniata, where they massacred
many of them, and marched off with prisoners
and plunder. Over these grounds, and up as far as
the mouth of the Youghiogany, Queen Aliquippa,
spoken of by Washington in his Journal, and visited
by him in 1753, governed with rude and simple sway.
Shingiss, King of the Delawares, the lover of Aliquippa,
had the seat of his regal power near McKee’s
Rocks, a little below Pittsburgh. He was young,
generous and brave, and alliances with him were
eagerly sought by both the French and the English.
At the rustic court of Aliquippa, and one of her chief
advisers, was Tonnaleuka, “prophet and medicine-man”—a
solemn, mysterious personage, who sought,
in caverns, to hold communion with the invisible
world, and who laid claim to great knowledge in occult
arts and mysterious rites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a distance of two or three miles from Homewood
lies Braddock’s Field, on the bank of the Monongahela
River—the theatre of one of the most prominent
occurrences in our colonial history. The total
defeat of General Braddock, on the 9th of July, 1755,
caused an electric shock throughout the colonies, and
occasioned profound grief and astonishment in the
mother country. But on this field of death and defeat
it was that Washington first gained a renown for wisdom
and bravery which will be forever associated
with his name. He was often heard to say that the
most beautiful spectacle he had ever beheld, “was the
display of the British troops on this eventful morning.
Every man was dressed in full uniform; the soldiers
were arrayed in columns and marched in exact order;
the sun gleamed from their burnished arms, the river
flowed tranquilly on one side, and the deep forest overshadowed
them with solemn grandeur on the other.
Officers and men were equally inspirited with cheering
hopes and confident expectations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet ere the gloom of twilight had encircled the
forest, more than half that brilliant army had fallen!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the many beautiful traditions relative to
Washington, which have been handed down to our
times, is one which rests on the authority of Dr.
Craik, who, it appears, was the intimate friend of
Washington from his boyhood to his death, and who
was with him at Braddock’s defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen years after that event, they traveled together
on an expedition to the western country, with
a party of woodsmen, for the purpose of exploring
wild lands. While near the junction of the Great
Kenhawa and Ohio rivers, a company of Indians came
to them with an interpreter, at the head of whom was
an aged and venerable chief. This personage made
known to them by the interpreter, that hearing Col.
Washington was in that region, he had come a long
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
way to visit him, adding that during the battle of the
Monongahela he had singled him out as a conspicuous
object; fired his rifle at him many times, and directed
his young warriors to do the same, but to his utter
astonishment none of their balls took effect. He was
then persuaded that the youthful hero was under the
special guardianship of the Great Spirit, (Manitou,)
and ceased to fire at him any longer. He was now
come to pay homage to the man who was the particular
favorite of heaven, and <span class='it'>who could never die
in battle</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle of Trenton was the turning point of the
War of Independence. For months before, the prospects
of the Colonies had been darkening, and but for
this bold stroke, would soon have set in gloom forever.
A brief review of the condition of affairs is necessary
to a just comprehension of the battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, in March, 1776, the British found themselves
compelled to evacuate Boston, they resolved to carry
their arms into the Middle States, and there strike at
the very heart of the nation. Accordingly, Sir William
Howe, after recruiting his forces at Halifax, sailed for
New York. On the 28th of August, at the head of an
army twenty-four thousand strong, he defeated the
Americans on Long Island; and, a few days subsequently,
compelled them to abandon the city of New
York. Washington now retreated to White Plains,
where an ineffectual engagement followed. Soon Fort
Washington, at the upper end of the island of Manhattan,
was stormed and carried by the royalist troops. Finding
it impossible to maintain his hold upon the Hudson, the
American general determined to retreat across New
Jersey; and accordingly, abandoning all his positions,
hurried over the North River, the British following in
quick pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, within two months after the battle of Long
Island, the cause of the Colonies sunk into almost hopeless
ruin. The enthusiasm which accompanied the
first outbreak at Lexington, had given way before the
privations of a protracted contest; and the soldiers,
who in 1775 had flocked unsolicited to the flag of their
country, in 1776 turned a deaf ear to the bounty offered
by Congress. In the army, the spirits of both officers
and men were broken by a long series of disasters.
Before the end of November the force of Washington,
by loss in battle, by the expiration of enlistment, by desertion,
and by other casualties, had dwindled down to
a little over three thousand men. With this remnant
of an army he retreated across New Jersey, hotly pursued
by Cornwallis, at the head of twenty thousand
well appointed troops; nor could he save himself from
utter ruin except by throwing the Delaware between
himself and his foe. On the 8th of December, he
crossed that river, and, having destroyed the bridges
behind him, gained a momentary respite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the eyes of nearly every man but the commander-in-chief,
this momentary relief seemed only an interval
of additional agony between the sentence and execution,
for ultimate escape appeared impossible. The
most sanguine believed that Philadelphia would fall before
the month was out. Congress, which had been
in session there, hurried off to Baltimore. Meantime,
the British, in secure possession of New Jersey, issued
a proclamation, requiring every inhabitant to lay down
his arms and take the oath of allegiance; and hundreds,
who had been among the most enthusiastic for resistance,
but who now despaired of success, hastened to
purchase mercy by a timely submission. Even gentlemen
high in rank on the side of the Colonies
wavered in their patriotism. The panic was universal.
The hurricane seemed about to prostrate every thing
before it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the gloom of this awful tempest, Washington,
almost alone, stood unappalled. Not for one moment
did his constancy forsake him. He saw the full peril
of his situation; but he brought to it the resources of
his mighty genius, and the unshaken resolution of his
giant soul. Never, in any period of his life, was he
greater than in this. No hint of submission crossed
his mind. “If Philadelphia falls,” he said in public,
“we must retreat to the Susquehanna, and thence, if
necessary, beyond the Alleghenies.” From the moment
he had crossed the Delaware, he had been revolving
in his mind a plan to change, by one bold act,
the whole aspect of the war. The British, instead of
being concentrated in some central point, were scattered
in detachments over New Jersey, a proceeding
they had adopted for the convenience of forage, believing
their enemy utterly powerless for aggressive
measures. Washington resolved to take advantage of
this error, and to strike at several of these detachments
at once. He learned that fifteen hundred men, principally
Hessians, were cantoned at Trenton, and that
smaller bodies lay at Bordentown, Burlington, Mount
Holly, and neighboring villages. To cut off one or
all of these from the main army was his design.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been said, by more than one interested writer,
that this masterly idea did not originate with Washington,
but was suggested by others; and various
officers have been named as the real authors of the
plan. But the very number of the aspirants destroys
the exclusive claims of each, and strengthens the notion
that the manœuvre sprung from the commander-in-chief
alone. The letters of Washington, for a fortnight
before the battle, point to the great thought he
was maturing in his mind. He was encouraged in his
plan by the alacrity with which the Pennsylvania militia,
under the command of General Cadwalader, began
to turn out; and by the reflection that, unless some bold
stroke was promptly hazarded, the spirits of the people
would sink into hopeless despondency. Accordingly,
he called a council of war, before which he laid his
daring scheme. As absolute secrecy was necessary to
the success of the enterprise, only the very highest
officers were admitted to this assembly, which met at
the head-quarters of Gen. Knox, in Upper Makefield,
Bucks County, Pa. The house is, we believe, still
standing, an antiquated dwelling of two stories, faithfully
depicted in our engraving.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
Little did those who met at that council of war,
though aware that mighty results hung upon their decision,
imagine a tithe of the truth. They knew that
the success or defeat of the Colonies might possibly
be involved, but they could not penetrate the
future, and foresee that the existence of the greatest and
most enlightened republic that ever lived, depended
on their conclusion. To their eyes it was chiefly a
question of preserving their little army, or at most
of protracting the contest into another campaign, that
they might have the benefit of whatever chances should
turn up. But in reality they were determining whether
the great problem of man’s capacity for self-government
should be tested or not—whether twenty millions
of people, as we now are, or one hundred millions, as
we will be by the close of the century, should rise into
freemen, or sink into slaves. Under God, all the progress
that liberty has made since that hour, here or
abroad, may be traced to the resolution adopted in that
council of war! That we are a free people; that our
wide-spread territories are filled with prosperity and
happiness; that the United States is looked to by the
whole world as the Mecca of the oppressed; and that
every breeze that blows from Europe brings sounds of
falling thrones, and nations breaking the chains which
have galled them for centuries—we owe to the determination
of that little assembly to sustain their commander-in-chief.
We can imagine when the council
rose, that the angel who watched over the youth of
our republic, and who had trembled for the result,
clapped his hands for joy, and that the exultant sound,
taken up by messenger after messenger, passed from
hierarch to hierarch, until all heaven <a id='rang'></a>rang with the
acclaim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plan, as finally determined on, was that Washington,
with the continental troops, should cross the
Delaware above Trenton, and move down to the attack
of that town; while Ewing, crossing the river
below, should make an assault simultaneously from
the lower side. Meantime, Cadwalader, with a strong
detachment of militia, crossing at Bristol, was, if possible,
to carry the posts at Burlington and Mount Holly.
The night of the 25th of December was chosen for the
surprise, as it was supposed that the enemy, on that
festive occasion, would be more or less off his guard.
The weather had been unusually warm for the season,
and there was no ice as yet in the river to impede the
crossing. Every thing looked promising until within
forty-eighty hours of the appointed time. Suddenly, at
this crisis, the weather set in cold, so that the Delaware
became full of floating ice, which rendered navigation
almost impossible. Nevertheless, Washington determined
to persist in his enterprise. Boats had been collected
for the transportation of his own detachment, at
McConkey’s Ferry, on the west side of the river, about
eight miles above Trenton. An express was sent to
Cadwalader to inform him the attempt would be made,
and to command him to cross, if possible, at Bristol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as evening came, the continentals, twenty-four
hundred in number, with a battery of twenty light
field pieces, were put in motion, and marched to the
ferry. It was a wild and threatening night. The wind
howled ominously over the landscape; a few stars only
were seen in the dark and troubled sky; and the ice
in the river, grinding and splitting as the tide moved
its huge masses one against another, filled the air with
foreboding sounds. In vain, for awhile, the boats
struggled in the current. Now locked in the arms of
apparently immovable fields of ice, and now in peril
from floating blocks that threatened to crush them,
they were borne hither and thither, and with difficulty
reached the shore, where new dangers awaited them
in cakes of the frozen material, which pushed end-wise
toward the bank, frequently overlapped and
almost engulfed them. At one time it was feared that
the artillery would have to be left behind. At last,
however, after almost incredible exertions, the little
army was ferried over, but the task, instead of being
achieved at midnight, as had been intended, was not
completed until three hours afterward. During the
suspense of this awful night, Washington, who had
crossed early, sat, it is said, on a bee-hive by the shore,
wrapped in his cloak, and watching the struggling boats
by the light of the few stars which broke here and
there through the stormy rack of heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two principal roads led from the landing-place
to Trenton. One, following the course of the river,
entered the town at its lower extremity; the other,
called the Pennington road, made a circuit into the
interior, and struck Trenton at its upper end. Dividing
his force, Washington took the latter route with one
detachment, while Sullivan, with the other, pursued
the river road. The instructions of the commander-in-chief
to the latter general were to push on until he
had reached Trenton, which he would probably be the
first to do, as his route was the shortest, and there wait
until he heard firing at the upper end of the town, when
he was to attack at once. By thus assaulting the British
simultaneously on both sides, Washington hoped, in
conjunction with the surprise, to render them an easy
prey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The march had scarcely been renewed when the
storm, which had been threatening all night, burst upon
the army. The snow, at first coming in squalls, finally
fell unintermittingly, accompanied occasionally with
gusts of sleet and hail. The two divisions moved in
company for nearly three miles before separating, and
Sullivan, remarking that the wet might spoil the powder,
asked his chief what was to be done in that emergency.
“We must fight with the bayonet,” was Washington’s
stern reply. The tempest now rapidly deepened. The
thick-falling flakes nearly obscured the way; the cold
became intense, and the wind, moaning across the
landscape, seemed to wail over the approaching ruin
of America. Many of the soldiers being scantily
clothed, were soon wet through and almost frozen.
Others had no shoes, and their feet, cut by the icy road,
left at every step a mark of blood. History presents
no parallel to that eventful march. When still some
distance from Trenton, two of the Americans, exhausted
and chilled, dropped from their ranks and died.
Yet still the remainder toiled on. No martial fife was
there, no banner flaunting on high, no squadrons of
cavalry to guard their flanks with triple rows of steel;
but in silence, like the Spartans bound to Thermopylæ,
the little band pursued its way. The inhabitants of
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
the farm-houses on the route, half waking from sleep,
fancied for a moment there were strange sounds upon
the breeze; but imagining that what they heard was but
the intonation of the tempest, they turned and slept again,
little thinking that the destinies of America quivered
that hour in the balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anxiety of Washington, during this protracted
march, rose to the highest pitch. He was aware that
if the attack failed, escape would be impossible, with
the wintry Delaware behind him. In deciding on this
bold move, he had staked not only his own life, but the
existence of his army, and with it the question of submission
and independence for his country, then and
forever after. He had put every thing “at the hazard
of a die.” Yet the flight of a single deserter, the accidental
discharge of a musket, or the occurrence of any
one of a dozen possible contingencies might destroy
success entirely. As the gray dawn approached, and
the vicinity of Trenton became apparent, his heart,
usually so calm, beat with terrible suspense. He rode
forward to the head of his troops. Just at this instant
the outpost of the enemy loomed up in front; a challenge
was heard—a hostile answer was given, and a
musket flashed across the breaking day. Fired by the
scene, and by the mighty responsibilities of the hour,
Washington rose in his stirrups, and pointing ahead
with his sword, exclaimed, in a voice husky with emotion,
but in words that will ever be immortal, “Soldiers,
now or never—this is our last chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the instant the men broke into a cheer, carried
away by the enthusiasm of the moment, and returning
the volley of the retreating guard, dashed forward in pursuit.
The British kept up a desultory fire as they fled,
dodging from house to house. At their head was a
young officer, who courageously exhorted them to stand
their ground, until a ball mortally wounding him, he fell
in the road, when they precipitately retired. The Americans
now saw, a little in advance, the houses of the
town; heard the alarm which was calling the British
soldiery together, and immediately after beheld the
enemy endeavoring to form a battery across King
street, directly in front. Not a moment was to be lost.
Six of Knox’s pieces immediately galloped into position,
and unlimbering, opened a destructive fire down the
street. When this discharge was over, the advanced
guard rushed forward, charged up to the muzzles of
the enemy’s guns, sabered some of the artillerists who
were about firing, and drove the rest away, and capturing
the pieces, turned two of them on the flying foe.
This occurred near where the feeder crosses the street.
Having thus destroyed the outworks of the enemy, the
successful assailants advanced down Queen street, extending
toward the left, across the fields, so as to cut
off the Hessians from retreating toward Princeton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, all was terror and confusion among the
enemy. The night had been one of festivity in Trenton,
the soldiers being in the beer-shops carousing, and the
officers indulging in mirth. Col. Rahl had been occupied
all night in playing cards at head-quarters, a house
belonging to Mr. Stacy Potts, and still standing near the
head of Greene street. When the firing at the picket
occurred, he stopped and listened. The sleet driving
against the window-pane, for a moment deceived him.
But when the rattle of the first volley came to his ears,
flinging down his cards, he rushed to the door. Here,
through the misty dawn, he beheld some Hessians
running down the street toward him, with the cry that
Washington, with his entire army, was upon them.
At this Rahl shouted to arms. The drums beat. In
an instant all Trenton was in a tumult. The privates
rushed from their quarters, some with, some without
arms; the officers were heard calling to the men, or
seen endeavoring to form the ranks; and the inhabitants,
roused from sleep, hurried to their windows, and
looking out for an instant on the uproar, hastened to
conceal themselves in the recesses of their dwellings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main division of the array had scarcely unlimbered
its battery in King street, when the sound of
firing from the lower extremity of the town, announced
that Sullivan had reached his position. Not three
minutes had elapsed between the time when the two
divisions came into action. The knowledge that the
enemy had been surprised in front and rear at once
inspired the Americans with fresh ardor, and they
charged down the two principal streets, King and
Queen, with an impetuosity that broke through every
attempt at resistance. In vain Rahl galloped to and
fro rallying his men; in vain the subordinate officers
exerted themselves; in vain the privates, ashamed to
be conquered without a blow, endeavored to make a
stand;—the enthusiasm of the assailants was irresistible,
the Hessians everywhere gave way, and when
Rahl soon after fell mortally wounded, his troops broke
into ignominious flight. A few threw themselves into
a stone mansion, where they were speedily forced to
surrender. The remainder fled precipitately toward
the Assinpink river, which flows along the lower end
of the town. Here, some endeavoring to swim across
were drowned or frozen to death; but the greater portion,
hemmed in on one side by Washington, and on
the other by Sullivan, and finding escape hopeless, laid
down their arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The victory was complete. The whole force of the
British at Trenton fell into the hands of Washington,
except a body of 500 horse, which fled in the direction
of Bordentown early in the action. Even these, however,
would not have made good their escape, if Gen.
Ewing, who was to have crossed below, had been able
to effect his purpose. The number of prisoners actually
captured was 909, of whom 23 were officers.
About a thousand stand of arms fell into the hands of
the victors. This glorious success was purchased
without the loss of a man, except the two who died on
the march; and but two officers, and a few privates
were wounded. The Hessians lost 7 officers and
nearly 30 men killed. As Washington rode over the
field after the conflict, he found Rahl, lying in the snow,
weltering in blood. The dying commander, supported
by a file of sergeants, tendered his sword to the victor,
and in broken accents seemed to implore clemency.
The American chief, touched by the spectacle, ordered
his own physician to attend the sufferer. But medical
assistance was in vain. Rahl, on being carried back
to his head-quarters, died soon after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire British army, west of Princeton, would
have fallen a prey to Washington, if Cadwalader and
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
Ewing had been able to cross at their respective places;
but neither effecting this, the posts at Bordentown,
Burlington, and Mount Holly, escaped. Meantime,
aware that the royal generals might concentrate their
forces and cut off his retreat, Washington decided to
re-cross the Delaware that very day with his prisoners.
Accordingly, before night, the captured Hessians were
transferred to Pennsylvania. The news of this great
victory spread with inconceivable swiftness; but such
was the opinion of British invincibility, that, at first,
few persons could be found to believe the tale. Aware
of the general incredulity, Washington hastened to
dispatch his prisoners to Philadelphia, where, on the
day succeeding the battle, they were paraded through
the streets, to the amazement, not less than to the delight
of the inhabitants. The effect of the victory on
the country was electric. The charm of British invincibility
was broken forever. Men no longer regarded
the cause of the Colonies as hopeless, but, encouraged
by this decisive success, looked forward confidently to
a glorious issue. In a word, the battle of Trenton
changed the wavering into friends; made those who
had been hostile, neutral; and convinced the patriot
that God was on his side, and that his country would
yet be free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The victory struck terror to the heart of the British
army. Cornwallis, who was about to embark for
Europe, abandoned his voyage in alarm, and hurried
back from New York to assume command of the troops
on the Delaware. His first step was to withdraw his
forces from the exposed points, and concentrate them
at Princeton and toward New Brunswick. Nor was
this precaution idle. Washington, having recruited
his troops, and being reinforced, crossed the Delaware
again on the 30th of December, and took post at
Trenton. To drive him from thence Cornwallis advanced
from Princeton, and, on the 2nd of January,
1777, assaulted the American lines, established on the
south side of the Assinpink. Three times he endeavored
to carry the bridge which separated him from his foe,
and three times he was repulsed. At last night put an
end to the contest. In the darkness, Washington abandoning
his position, marched on Princeton, intending to
cut off the royal general from his communications. A
battle ensued at this place, which was scarcely decided
in favor of the Americans, when Cornwallis, hurrying
up from Trenton, compelled the victors to draw off to
the high grounds in the direction of Morristown. The
British general, completely baffled, fell back to the
Raritan, abandoning all his posts on the Delaware.
The result of this splendid series of operations on
the part of Washington was to deliver New Jersey
from the enemy, in the short space of ten days. Thus,
when supposed to be annihilated, the American general,
like some fabled genius, had suddenly risen up, saved
Philadelphia, recovered all he had lost in the preceding
two months, and given an impetus to victory which
never ceased until the red cross of Great Britain
sunk into dust on the plains of Yorktown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When hereafter the military genius of Washington
is called in question, let the story of Trenton be remembered.
Napoleon always spoke of this ten days’
campaign as one of the most able on record. Botta,
the Italian historian, said of it, “Achievements so
astonishing gained for the American commander a
very great reputation, and were regarded with wonder
by all nations, as well as by the Americans; every
one applauded the prudence, the firmness, and the
daring of Washington; all declared him the saviour
of his country; all proclaimed him <span class='it'>equal to the most
renowned commanders of antiquity</span>.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>OR LENDING A NAME.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY FRANK SUMMERS.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>AN EVENING AT HOME.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Merritt was seated by the centre-table in the
back-parlor, as was his custom of an evening after the
tea things had been cleared away, and around it were
clustered his little family. His wife and daughter
Emma, a blooming maiden of sixteen, were busy with
their needles, and George, his only son, was diligently
conning a lesson for the morrow, while a little cherub
slept quietly in a willow cradle at the feet of the
mother. Mr. Merritt was a home man, and he loved
the quiet happiness which always dwelt there far better
than the noisy revels of the club or the bar-room.
Ah! were there more home husbands, how many
firesides that have never known a smile would be lit
up in brightness and sunshine! How many hearts
now lone and desolate, would be made glad!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a winter evening, and the fire burned cheerily
in the back parlor of the snug dwelling where lived
Mr. Merritt. It was a New England home, and when
we have said this, as much of comfort hath been conveyed
as if a page had been devoted to the description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Merritt was reading from the last Gazette one
of those glowing paragraphs, in which the West was
painted as a land flowing with milk and honey; <span class='it'>the</span>
El Dorado where struggling poverty might riot in exhaustless
riches; where broad acres of wealth could
be purchased for a song; and, in short, where all the
romantic visions of the most ardent adventurer would
be eclipsed by the surpassing reality. Mr. Merritt
had read articles of a similar tenor before; first, with
indifference, but latterly with strong interest. He was
becoming a little infected with the epidemic, which
had already carried off several of his acquaintances,
and being now suddenly involved in pecuniary difficulties,
was almost persuaded to follow. As he laid down
the newspaper he turned to his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, wife, what say you to going West in the
spring? You know that my payments for Warden
will oblige me to sell a part of my little property to
meet them; would it not be better to dispose of the
whole, and purchase a farm in Illinois, where, if the
half that is told be true, we would be able to live comfortably
and provide something handsome for our
children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Merritt glanced around the little group, and a
tear trembled in her eye as it rested on the cradle.
She was thinking of the tales she had heard, how sickness
and death had smitten the hopes of fond parents
who had emigrated to new countries, and how, before
they had accumulated with much toil and privation,
wherewithal to satisfy their desires, the climate had
left for their children no wants, save a coffin and a
grave. But she brushed the tear secretly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you really serious,” said Mrs. Merritt, at
length, “in wishing to give up New England forever?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly in wishing it, my dear,” returned Mr.
Merritt, “but what is now a matter of choice may,
ere long, be necessity. True, it would cost a severe
trial to separate from the friends whom we have so
long known and loved, and to exchange the delights of
their society for a wilderness, but <span class='it'>we</span> would be together
still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we are all the world to each other,” exclaimed
his wife, forgetting her sadness for a moment,
in the devotion which, twenty years after marriage,
was rather strengthened than subdued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You leave Emma and me out of the question altogether,
mother,” said little George, who, though apparently
absorbed in his book, had been listening all
the while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my love, you are both very dear to your parents;”
and she bent over him and kissed his brow,
the very image of his father’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, mother, I was only jesting,” returned
George, quite grieved, yet wondering why his mother
should have taken it so seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we surely going to live in Illinois, mother?”
continued George, after a pause, “among the prairies
and all? O how glad I shall be; I do want to see a
prairie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, George, don’t you care about leaving your
schoolmates and playfellows?” asked his sister reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes! I forgot, I shall be very sorry. I shall
be sorrier though for poor William Warden. He will
be so grieved when he hears that Emma is going
away, and he will never see her any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! young chatterbox,” retorted his sister, at
the same time administering him a gentle admonition
with her thimbled finger, and blushing scarlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The infant sleeper happened to wake up at this
juncture, and made sundry noisy intimations from the
cradle; otherwise Mrs. Merritt might have noticed the
sudden expression of pain that passed over her husband’s
features, at what George had said concerning
William Warden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Miss Emma, she hurried to the cradle on the
first demonstration, and became completely wrapt in
a lullaby, which she sung as earnestly as though
George had made no revelation, and William Warden
was all a fable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Merritt resumed his newspaper, and George
his lesson.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>RETROSPECTIVE.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Merritt was a mechanic. By industry and perseverance
he had gained step by step, until he was the
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>
possessor of a comfortable property. Mr. Warden,
the merchant, had been his neighbor for several years,
and was engaged in a flourishing business. Now Mr.
Merritt being one of those amiable dispositions that
could never say “No,” when asked a favor; it consequently
happened that when Mr. Warden wanted a
small discount at bank, and requested Mr. Merritt to
lend his name, merely for form’s sake, as the laws of
the institution required several signatures, (a very
troublesome law, as Mr. Warden remarked, for it
obliged him to tax the friendship of his neighbors, but
he would be happy to reciprocate at any time that Mr.
Merritt might wish an accommodation,) he, Mr. Merritt,
signed it without hesitation—and not only one,
but several.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first note became due, and Mr. Warden paid it.
The second matured, and in the mean time Mr. Warden’s
speculations having failed, he was not in funds,
and Mr. Merritt received a notice of protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that Mr. Merritt began to reflect upon
the possible consequences of lending a name. He
urged Mr. Warden to make some arrangement by
which he would be released from the indorsements.
The merchant apologized to Mr. Merritt for the accidental
protest, which had happened entirely through
an error of the clerk’s in entering the note on his bill-book;
that functionary having made it fall due about
two weeks subsequent to its actual maturity; and
therefore Mr. Warden had not prepared to meet it.
He felt extremely pained, he said, that his valued and
esteemed friend should doubt his solvency, or for an
instant imagine him so base and devoid of honor as to
involve <span class='it'>him</span> in loss, even though he should fail to meet
other obligations. The mechanic was satisfied with
this explanation, and regretted that he had spoken to
Mr. Warden on the subject. But there came another
protest, and others again in quick succession; and now
Mr. Merritt felt real alarm. He saw the merchant
once more, and begged of him security to the amount
of his indorsements. Mr. Warden sincerely regretted
that it was out of his power to do so, as he had just
made a conveyance of all his effects to the bank!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mechanic was thunderstruck. This was indeed
a cruel blow. There was but one other indorser
with Mr. Merritt, and they were on Warden’s paper
for ten thousand dollars; one half of his <span class='it'>all</span> gone at a
single stroke. Yet there are hundreds who, not knowing
what they do, are every day lending their names
for no better consideration, and are reaping the same
bitter repentance as did Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, then, was the situation of the mechanic at the
opening of this history.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE BANK ATTORNEY.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A month transpired, after the events narrated in the
foregoing chapters, and all of Warden’s notes had been
protested. It was impossible for Mr. Merritt to pay
these heavy and unexpected demands without sacrificing
his property, should he be pressed for immediate
payment, and he resolved to call upon the bank attorney,
with the faint hope of obtaining an extension; or,
at least, prevailing upon that officer to save him the
disastrous expenses of a suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Mr. Merritt! He was entirely unacquainted
with the tender mercies of banks and bank attorneys,
or he would have prepared himself for the worst.
Neither did he know that, of all bank attorneys, he
could not have fallen into more evil hands than Isaac
Rock, Esq., Counsellor-at-Law and Notary Public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In person Esquire Rock was broad-shouldered, and
rather short and clumsy than otherwise; his features
hard and forbidding. His heart, if he had one, was
steel, and he prided himself more upon his firmness
than upon any other of his numerous high qualities.
Tears, prayers and entreaties were alike wasted upon
him. Indeed, were not that old saying, “hard as a
rock,” of greater antiquity than any date to which
Esquire Rock could lay claim, it would undoubtedly
have passed into a proverb from his day henceforth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst this attorney entertained a most unmitigated
contempt for the victims of poverty and misfortune, he
had a profound and exalted sense of his own individual
consequence, and delighted to witness the cringing
spirit and suppliant knee of the awe-stricken subjects
of his power. Whosoever committed a sin against
the dignity of Esquire Rock was straightway an outlaw
beyond all hope of forgiveness; and wo be to him
thus sinning, who should fall into the gripe of the
attorney. Besides all these qualifications, however,
Esquire Rock had a careful eye upon his temporal interests,
and could manage a case in a way to swell his
legal perquisites, to an amount at once the envy and
admiration of the whole brotherhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esquire Rock was fumbling over a miscellaneous
collection of manuscripts one morning, when a rap
was heard at the office door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” said the attorney, settling back in his
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The visiter opened the door at this invitation, and
advanced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Esquire Rock within?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Esquire Rock,” answered that personage
haughtily. “Be seated, sir. Business with me, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Merritt, sir. I am indorser with John
Fields on Warden’s notes, and have called⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know it,” interrupted the attorney, a
scarcely perceptible, though dangerous smile playing
upon his features—“and you will have them to pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am aware that Mr. Warden has failed, but it
will be impossible for me to pay the amount at present,
and I have called to beg a little indulgence. Five
thousand dollars is a large sum to raise, especially by
a humble mechanic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have property, Mr. Merritt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have some property, Esquire Rock, but were I
forced to sell immediately, it would bring but a fraction
of its real value.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The law must take its course, sir,” said the attorney,
decidedly; and he looked at Mr. Merritt, then
at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mechanic understood the hint, and when he
met the attorney’s glance, he saw no hope there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had thought,” said he, “that the manner in which
I became involved in this misfortune would entitle me
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
to some slight favor at your hands—to a trifling delay
by which I might avoid total ruin; but I perceive I am
mistaken in looking for mercy here,” he added, bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esquire Rock was utterly confounded at the man’s
audacity. A poor mechanic to beard <span class='it'>him</span>—Isaac Rock,
Esquire, counsellor at law, and notary public! The
thing was unprecedented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span> thought!” exclaimed he, as soon as he had
recovered sufficiently to reply. “Do you understand
law, sir? You have no right to think, sir. The majesty
of the law is trampled under foot when mechanics are
permitted to think⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or asses to practice at the bar,” retorted Mr. Merritt,
indignantly, turning to depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fiery furnace of the attorney’s rage threatened
to consume him at this new and flagrant act of daring;
and he was driven to disclose a secret, which he had
intended to hold in suspension, like the sword of Democles,
over his victim. He called to Mr. Merritt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back, Mr. Merritt; let me give you a little
further light upon this case.” Esquire Rock’s manner
had undergone a sudden change, which puzzled the
mechanic exceedingly, as he obeyed the summons. All
traces of wrath had vanished, and he received the mechanic
with something of the air of complacency, with
which an epicure might be supposed to contemplate the
preparations for an extensive feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know John Fields, Mr. Merritt?” he
inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not—but Mr. Warden told me that he was a
wealthy cousin of his, living at Salem. Do <span class='it'>you</span> know
him, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attorney’s face lighted up with the same curious
smile that had before accompanied the mention of that
indorser’s name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Merritt, John Fields is a distant relative
of the celebrated John Smith, an imaginary being, as I
have ascertained, who lends his name for the accommodation
of such of his friends as want a discount.
The name is not worth one copper, Mr. Merritt, and
therefore we shall make the money out of you. We
will have an execution out shortly for ten thousand
dollars and the costs, which will be a thousand more,
or it shall be my fault. What think you of that, Mr.
Merritt?” he continued, watching the effects of the
development with intense pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! it was too true. Mr. Warden had been in the
habit of conforming to the rules of the bank, by furnishing
fictitious indorsers to the requisite number;
a harmless evasion, which the president readily winked
at, in consideration of a trifling token of good will,
provided always, that Warden obtained one genuine
and responsible name in addition to his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Merritt was so utterly stupefied at this new intelligence
of treachery, that he walked off mechanically,
without answering a word. Esquire Rock gazed after
him until he was gone; when he again returned to his
papers, muttering aloud, “chew that awhile, Mr.
Merritt—asses practice at the bar, do they?”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>AFFLICTIONS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Merritt had nearly reached his dwelling before
he recovered from the confusion into which his faculties
had been thrown by the astounding intelligence
conveyed by the attorney. As he now gazed upon his
peaceful home, it seemed more beautiful than ever.
Alas! it could be his no longer. The savings of long
years—the earnings of days and nights of hard toil, so
carefully husbanded—the little luxuries that had been
done without—the self-denials that had been practiced—the
privations undergone, to gather a substance which
should soothe life’s decline—all, all gone at a single
blow, swept away forever! How could he impart the
dreadful news to his wife! How could he endure to
meet the companion of his bosom and his darling
family, plunged, through his own imprudence, (he felt,)
into hopeless want. “She shall be happy a little
longer,” thought he, and retraced his steps to his shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Merritt did not, as usual, go home to dinner on
that day, but remained in his shop, hour after hour,
absorbed in deep and bitter thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can there be no law to punish such monstrous corruption?”
said he to himself, as he closed the shop for
the night. Here again Mr. Merritt displayed his ignorance,
in supposing that men in high places could be
called to account for mere trifles like this. In fact, he
did not know how very seldom <span class='it'>law</span> means <span class='it'>justice</span>,
when wealth and station are placed at the bar for trial,
or he would have spared himself the question. He
walked slowly homeward, endeavoring as much as
possible to compose his agitated spirits for the scene
which he knew awaited him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eye of love is keen of penetration, and Mrs.
Merritt discovered as soon as the mechanic entered
the cottage that all was not right. Knowing of his
intended visit to the attorney, her imagination pictured
a thousand causes of alarm, and overcome by
contending emotions, she threw herself upon his neck,
bursting into a flood of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak, my dear husband,” she cried. “I see
from your pallid face and bloodless lips, that some new
and dreadful calamity has befallen us. O reveal it all
to me, I can bear any thing save my fears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Concealment would be useless,” said the mechanic,
“for you must know it sooner or later. Endeavor to
compose yourself, dearest, things are not as bad as you
apprehend. To see you thus is a severer pang than I
have encountered before. Wife, we are only—beggars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Merritt, with astonishing calmness, proceeded
to relate his interview with Esquire Rock, and its
results, nearly as we have narrated them in the last
chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With what keen delight would the bank attorney
have looked upon that scene of anguish and despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first paroxysms over, Mrs. Merritt became
more calm, and listened attentively to the end. That
day of gloom was closed by fervent supplication to
the High Source of all hope and consolation, for
strength and support against the tempest that awaited
them.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>A MEETING.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due time Mr. Merritt’s effects were levied upon,
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
and advertised for sale. When it was known that he
was ruined, envy and jealousy triumphed, and the vile
tongue of slander was unloosed upon his reputation.
People who had envied his prosperity heretofore,
gloried in his ruin. It descended even to the children,
and a stout, malicious boy, threatened to whip George
the very next time he went to school. So certain
is misfortune to meet with taunt and insult every
where.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this period, so fruitful of evil to the Merritt
family, young Warden, though before a frequent visiter,
did not cross their threshold. Emma could not help
wondering where he had gone, or why he had not said
good-bye, or whether he had really forgotten her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma was returning from an afternoon visit, some
half mile from her father’s, and with a view to escape
observation, she turned down a by-path, and walked
slowly homeward. Soon she heard the sound of approaching
footsteps, and she felt a strange and unaccountable
agitation, although she neither turned her
head nor quickened her pace. They came near, and a
voice called, “Emma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no stranger’s voice that brought the blood
rushing unbidden to that fair girl’s cheek. William
Warden was at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma, a little piqued by his long absence, could not
resist playing the woman, and she drew herself up
rather coldly, “Good evening, Mr. Warden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first time she had called him Mr.
Warden. It had always been William, before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emma—Miss Merritt, I mean—I have no right to
call you Emma, now; the man who has involved you
in ruin, and wrecked the prospects of your dearest
friends, is my father; and I feel that you hate and despise
me. I cannot endure this disgrace, and am about
to leave for another country, where the shame of my
father will not be known, and where the dishonor attached
to his name will not hang like a mill-stone
around my neck, paralyzing all my efforts to rise to
respectability and honor. But I could not leave you
forever without seeing you once more, and for this opportunity
I have watched long and anxiously. I dared
not offend your father with my presence under his
roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma’s resolution about the little womanly display
of temper suddenly vanished, her warm heart softened,
and was throbbing in sympathy, ere the first tones of
Warden’s musical voice died away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O no, William, he does not blame you!” she exclaimed,
with tearful eyes, “indeed he does not. He
knows you for all that is generous and good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have not you blamed me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, William—no, never! O, William, how could
you accuse me thus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you for these kind words, Emma, they inspire
me with new hopes. And now, Emma, as we
must soon part, perhaps forever, tell me, if these things
had never happened, if my father had still continued in
prosperity, and free from the crime which makes his
name odious to your ear, could you have loved me,
then, Emma—would you, Emma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma answered not loud, but the gentle whisper
reached the ear of love, and William Warden sealed
it in a long, burning kiss upon her glowing lips. They
were happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farewell, dearest Emma, we meet again,” was
all he said, and when she looked up William Warden
was gone.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>RELIEF.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There <span class='it'>are</span> hearts among the rich and powerful—and
would to God they were more numerous—whose
pulses flow in kindly sympathy for the distresses of
their fellow-creatures, and whose wealth ever ministers
to the necessities of the children of sorrow. Such
have their reward, more glorious than the laurels which
deck the conqueror’s brow—the blessings, prayers, and
outpourings of the grateful spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the extent of their means, Mr. Merritt and his
family had always aided the poor and needy; and they
were not now deserted in their affliction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every nerve had been strained to avert the threatening
storm; but all in vain. Stricken and depressed,
the mechanic sunk down in despair. Not a ray of
hope pierced the blackness of the future. His all
would not pay the execution and costs of sale, and
there followed, for himself, a prison—for his family,
starvation. Wise counsellors had been consulted, and
they decided that there was no proof of fraud which
could invalidate the claim. No law could set it aside.
The bank attorney already saw his victim wasting in
the cold cell of a debtor’s jail and exulted in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as the darkest hour is that which ushers in the
dawn, so, in this hour of trial, when the clouds lowered
thick and heavily—a friendly helper came. One, who
had been rescued years before, by Mr. Merritt’s own
bounty, from poverty and degradation, and by his aid
had commenced a career which secured him fortune
and prosperity, heard of the troubles of his benefactor,
and hastened to his relief. With the delicacy of true
benevolence, this gentleman set about his excellent
mission, in a way to be of effectual benefit to Mr.
Merritt, while it relieved him of the oppressive sense
of obligation, which is often made to accompany good
deeds, but which more surely crushes the proud spirit
than would the miseries they seek to alleviate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this gentleman the mechanic received the following
letter by post:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='it'>G——, March 10, 183-.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Merritt,—Dear Sir,—I have had it some time
in view to purchase property in your village, whenever
a favorable opportunity should occur. I learn by the
newspapers, that your real estate will soon be sold on
execution, and it being the most desirable situation with
which I am acquainted, I am anxious to buy it. As it
will be out of my power to attend the sale, (if you have
not made other arrangements,) please write me by return
mail, what will be the sum of execution and costs,
and if not more than the fair value of the property,
I will advance the amount, and close the bargain
at once.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“G—— S——.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The early and important services which he had rendered
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>
to the writer of this letter were dismissed from
the memory of Mr. Merritt, with the ordinary events
of the time at which they were conferred. The latter
had, not long after, removed to another town, and they
had not met since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter was a business-like document, as we have
seen—containing no allusions to the past—breathing no
professions of gratitude—proffering no gifts of charity;
yet it exerted a happier influence in cheering the mechanic,
than though every line had been teeming with
protestations of pity and regard. It came like a messenger
of life, and bade him hope. First, he read it
silently—then aloud—then to his wife—then Emma and
George participated in the joyous news; and the infant,
receiving an unusual number of kisses, no doubt
understood it too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An answer was forwarded by the ensuing mail, setting
forth the circumstances of the case—the amount
required to free the estate from incumbrance—and
further, stating that this was five hundred dollars less
than the assessed valuation of the property at the annual
appraisement—that he considered it worth one
thousand dollars more than that appraisement; but, in
consequence of the forced sale, he expected to lose
that much, or more; and therefore, as he was obliged
to sell, would be glad to have him take the property
and redeem the execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this was dispatched, their fears regained the
ascendency. They had been, perhaps, too sanguine,
the price might be considered too high—and all was
anxiety, perplexity and dread, until the close of a week,
when there came the following reply:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='it'>G——, April 2, 183-.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Merritt—Dear Sir,—Your favor, in answer to
inquiries contained in my letter of 10th ult., came duly
to hand. I think the property sufficiently reasonable at
your valuation, and have no wish to take advantage
of your pecuniary embarrassments to obtain a reduction
of price. Therefore, if you please, you will consider
me the purchaser. The enclosed check for eleven
thousand dollars will release the estate from the execution,
and the remainder I will pay as soon as the
necessary titles are perfected. I have appointed Mr.
—— my agent in the matter, who will attend to their
arrangement.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“G—— S——.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When Mr. Merritt took this last letter from the post-office,
he determined to take it home and open it there.
But his anxiety proved too great, and the seal was
broken. The check came first in sight, and he panted
for breath. He read on, quickening his pace more and
more, until he arrived at home, almost on a full run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God! we are free!” he exclaimed. “Wife,
read this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did read it to the end. The day had dawned,
and the bright sun of hope shone once more. What a
happy family was Mr. Merritt’s! Free from debt!
They did not forget, in the fullness of their joy, to assemble
around the family altar, and pour forth fervent
thanksgiving to the Hand which had supported them
through tribulation, and had brought them succor when
there was none to help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next morning, to the utter dismay of the bank
attorney, Mr. Merritt walked into his office, and demanded
the execution, at the same time presenting the
money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Choking with rage and surprise, the attorney gazed
first at the money, and thence at the mechanic, and
proceeded to an iron closet, which he opened, and
brought out the notes. Mr. Merritt paid them every
one, and with an air of mingled triumph and scorn,
bade Esquire Rock a good morning, and left the office.
That gentleman’s wrath broke out afresh when he was
again alone, and he occasionally muttered aloud, “The
scoundrel! I could have killed him!” and no doubt he
spoke truly.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE FAREWELL.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After many consultations and long reflection, Mr.
Merritt decided to emigrate to the West. Though repeatedly
urged by the new purchaser to remain for a
time at his old home, he refused, being determined, as
he said, to try farming, and the new country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About two months after the sale, Mr. Merritt received
the last instalment of the purchase-money; and
having parted with such of his household goods as
would be unnecessary where he was going—save a
few dear old pieces of furniture, which they could not
bear to give up—he had nearly two thousand dollars
to invest in lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With many tears they parted from one old friend and
another, and lingered affectionately around every familiar
object, until no more excuses could be framed
for delay—and at length commenced their journey.
Emma would have given the world to have seen
William Warden once more; but he had left the village,
and gone, no one knew whither. Little George,
notwithstanding his curiosity to see a prairie, had his
sorrows too, and wept as though his heart would break.
The infant was the only one who had no regrets for
their old home.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE PRAIRIE HOME.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Illinois—as every traveler in the Great West knows—abounds
in prairies, many of them of great extent.
Among them all, however, there are none so large and
varied as <span class='it'>La Prairie</span>, so called, which stretches from
the Mississippi River more than a hundred miles into
the interior. Now, it spreads to the horizon’s verge
a vast level, carpeted, in the spring-time, with luxuriant
verdure, amid which are scattered myriads of
beautiful wild flowers—anon, the surface slopes in
gentle undulations, rising higher as you proceed, until
they become romantic and broken, dividing into hills
and ridges, while clear and sparkling rivulets flow down
the valleys between. Here and there the eye rests
upon an oasis of timber, covering a few acres, and
again the traveler scans the field of vision in vain for a
single tree or shrub to relieve the wearisome monotony
of space. Although the soil is rich, and easy of
cultivation, the extreme scarcity of timber has deterred
the emigrant from its occupation, and, save a few settlements
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
in the neighborhood of these timber-groves,
La Prairie is to this day the same solitude as when the
buffalo fed in its green pastures, undisturbed by the
ride of the pale-faced hunter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having an opportunity of buying an improvement in
one of these beautiful groves, at a trifling advance from
the government price, Mr. Merritt selected it for his
home. They named it Elmwood, and Selkirk, in the
South American isle, was not more isolated from his
race than were the mechanic and his little family in
their new abode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The limits of this history will not allow us to detail
the many ingenious devices that were of necessity resorted
to, or the ludicrous contrivances of Mr. Merritt
in the way of carpentry, or the substitutes adopted for
the thousand conveniences they had always been used
to, and never knew the value of before; but suffice it
to say, the mechanic labored earnestly in his new vocation,
and succeeded in planting acres sufficient to
insure a plentiful provision for his little flock.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>SICKNESS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second summer had nearly passed away, when
sickness visited Elmwood. Mr. Merritt was prostrated
by a violent fever. Early and late his wife
watched by his bed. Sleep was a stranger to her eyes.
Agonizing prayers ascended in petition for his recovery.
At last they were heard. Slowly the sick
man improved, and after many weeks, was able to
breathe the fresh air, and walk abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, the dear little prattler, the youngest child,
drooped. The petted one lay helpless in its willow
cradle, and pale and anxious faces gathered around it.
Eyes, red with weeping, witnessed its struggles.
Several days it lingered after hope had fled the broken-hearted
mourners, and then the little sufferer was
called in its pure, unspotted innocence, to Heaven!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>A STORM ON THE PRAIRIE.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short time after Mr. Merritt settled at Elmwood,
a small village sprung up about twenty miles distant,
on the edge of the prairie; and, as the country filled up
beyond, it was made the county-seat; and a store or
two being established there, it became quite a market-place
for the farmers on the prairie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a cold morning in January of the third winter of
his residence at Elmwood, Mr. Merritt, having some
business which called him to the village, Miss Emma
improved the opportunity to accompany him, for the
purpose of exercising her taste in the purchase of a
few articles from the store. The snow was too thin
for sleighing, and the wagon was therefore rigged with
two chairs and a cloak, together with a buffalo robe
for the feet; and, all things being ready, they set off in
high spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma succeeded to her utmost satisfaction in cheapening
and securing the requisite bargains, and was
ready to return, long before her father had completed
his share of the business of the day. It was nearly
night, and she was quite out of patience, when Mr.
Merritt drove up with the one-horse wagon, to convey
them homeward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid you will have a storm, sir,” said the
polite shopkeeper, bowing a farewell, and glancing at
the clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not before we reach Elmwood,” replied
Mr. Merritt, returning the salutation, and applying the
whip. He cast an anxious eye overhead, and applied
the whip more vigorously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dark clouds had gradually overspread the sky, and
were thickening every moment, while an occasional
gust sweeping along the prairie, gave evident manifestation
of an approaching storm. They had not gone
half the distance, when a feathery snow-flake floated
slowly down, and then another, and another. Now
they came thicker and faster, and the darkness increased
so much, that Mr. Merritt could hardly discern
the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emma, dearest, wrap your cloak closely, it will
be very cold,” said he, urging his horse to greater
speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very comfortable, now, father,” returned
Emma; “are we not nearly home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope that we may be, for it will be a dreadful
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the night set in, the wind increased. The snow
had hitherto fallen gently, but now it was driven into
their faces by the gale, and almost blinded them. It
grew colder, too, very rapidly, and the mechanic’s
fingers could hardly grasp the lines. Still he continued
to ply the whip, and they rolled on at a gallop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emma, can you see a light?—we should be near
Elmwood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, father, I can see nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again they hurried on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look all around you, Emma,” said her father,
anxiously; “we must certainly be nearly home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She strained her eyes in every direction, but no light
was visible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dreadful thought flashed upon him then. He stopped
his horse, leaped from the wagon, and bent his eyes
close to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O my God!” he exclaimed, in agony, “we have
lost the road!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The storm howled in fury—the track was entirely
covered with snow—to go forward was uncertainty—to
return would be folly—to remain, was to perish.
What man, how stout-hearted soever he might be,
would not have quailed at such a prospect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall we do, father? I am very cold;” said
Emma, faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven only can preserve us, my dear Emma.
Take this buffalo, I do not need it,” said the kind
father, carefully wrapping the fur robe to shield her
tender frame from the storm, while an involuntary
shivering through his system evinced the extent of his
self-denial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an earnest invocation to Heaven, in silent
petition, for their preservation, he resolved to go forward,
and leave the result with Providence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you warm enough, Emma?” said her father,
after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>
“I am not cold now, father, but I am <span class='it'>so</span> sleepy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, exert yourself—do not sleep!” said the
mechanic, in alarm—“it is death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, a dull, heavy sound was borne along
the gale. Mr. Merritt listened. It was not the wind.
Another report was heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“’Tis a gun!” he exclaimed. “Heaven be praised!
it is a gun from Elmwood!” He turned his horse’s
head in the direction of the sound. A third time the
report was heard, evidently nearer. Soon a faint glare
was visible, which continued to increase as they approached.
There stood his dwelling, with every window
brilliantly illuminated; and just as he reached the
house, the door was opened, and George appeared
with the gun, which he was about to fire again, when
he saw them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, they’ve come!” he shouted, “and this in
honor of their return,” he added, blazing away, and
almost thrown on his back by the recoil a moment
after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother was at the door ere he had finished.
Mr. Merritt was so stiffened and benumbed with cold
that he descended from the wagon with difficulty to
meet the warm embrace of his wife; but Emma sat
still nor spoke. She was asleep. At this discovery,
the excitement and alarm of the mechanic seemed to
endow him with superhuman strength, and lifting her
as if she had been an infant, he hurried into the house
with his lifeless burden, and laid her upon a couch.
With frantic energy they applied the restoratives at
command—and they were blessed. Her eyes opened
slowly, and she attempted to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The crisis is past, and our Emma is preserved!”
exclaimed Mrs. Merritt, clasping her hands together
in joyful thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emma was soon entirely recovered, but the careful
mother forbade exertion, and with her own hands prepared
and brought a nice cordial to her daughter’s bed,
under the soothing influence of which she ere long
sunk into pleasant and refreshing slumbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Merritt, while supper progressed, was relating
to the mechanic the anxiety she had felt for their safety
when night came on, and he had not returned; and
how George had suggested the thought of firing the
gun, which had led to their preservation, when a loud
knock was heard at the door. George opened it, and
a stranger entered, muffled to the eyes in a capacious
cloak, which was almost concealed by a covering
of snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can a traveler find shelter with you to-night?”
asked the new comer, who appeared to be a young
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid that we should drive a human being
from our roof on such a night as this,” said Mr. Merritt.
“Sir, you are quite welcome to the best we have
to offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The traveler expressed his thanks, and divested of
his cloak, exposed the features of a handsome young
man, of apparently not more than two-and-twenty
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden exclamation burst simultaneously from
the lips of Mr. and Mrs. Merritt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William Warden!” It was he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You recognize me, I see,” said Warden, “although
three years have changed me somewhat;” and he continued,
“will you, Mr. Merritt, for the moment, forget
that I am the son of my father, and accord to me the
welcome of a stranger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mechanic evidently struggled with bitter recollections,
but subduing them, offered his hand calmly to
Mr. Warden. “You are my guest, Mr. Warden,”
said he, “and as such, are not the less entitled to my
hospitality that you are the son of one who has done
cruel wrong to me and mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not irretrievable wrong, thank Heaven!” replied
young Warden. “The son shall expiate the
crimes of the father. To-morrow, Mr. Merritt—to-morrow
shall be the dawn of a happier day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Merritt made no reply. Warden did not resume
the subject, and they sat some time in silence.
William had frequently glanced around the room since
his entrance, and his countenance now assumed a perplexed
and anxious expression. There was one missing,
of whom he wished, yet feared to know. At length
he mustered sufficient courage to inquire in as indifferent
a tone as he could assume, “Where is Miss
Emma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Merritt then recounted the history of Emma’s
trip to the village, and her narrow escape from a
dreadful death on the prairies, and how the firing had
been the means of their rescue; to all of which he
listened with intense interest. He, too, had heard the
gun, and been saved by it from a similar fate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next morning Emma was quite herself again.
She had not heard of the traveler’s arrival, and when
she came into the breakfast-room and saw William
Warden, she almost fainted. The tell-tale blood,
which had at first retreated, now crimsoned her cheek—and
William himself seemed to have caught the contagion,
for his face was all on fire. They shook hands
as composedly as possible under the circumstances,
and succeeded in exchanging a few interrogatories
without betraying the secret agitation of their hearts
to the eye of the mechanic. If William had loved
Emma at sixteen, how much more worthy of his love
did she now appear. She had grown taller, and every
childish grace had matured into beautiful womanhood.
The climate had tinged her complexion with the
slightest possible brown, and her plain western dress
fitted her charming figure so well, that he would not
have exchanged it for the richest robe that ever decked
a haughty ball-room belle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>William, too, how vastly he was improved. Three
years had transformed the slight stripling into the form
of manly beauty; and his eyes beamed with the intelligence
of superior intellect. Emma thought him even
handsomer than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast was over, Mr. Merritt and young
Warden walked out together, and when the latter returned
to the house, he found Emma alone. He approached
the fair girl, and his voice trembled as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emma,” said William, “have you forgotten our
last parting yet. O, Emma, the words you then whispered
in my ear have sustained and encouraged me
since that day; and the hope of one day being worthy
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
of you, and repairing the injury done to your father, has
borne me onward and upward over difficulties of every
kind, until at last I am here to remind you of your promise.
‘I will be yours, and yours only, William,’ you
said; and now, dearest Emma, I have just explained
all to your father, who will not withhold his blessing,
and it needs but your confirmation to seal my happiness
forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happy girl did not withhold it.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>A MORNING CALL IN NEW ENGLAND.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you heard the news about Mr. Merritt?”
said a young lady, to an acquaintance, whom she was
honoring with a morning call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have not; what about him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you know that Mr. Warden ruined him, and
his property was sold to a gentleman in ——, and the
mechanic and his family moved to the West. This was
about three years ago. Well, Mr. Warden’s son was
violently in love with Mr. Merritt’s daughter, Emma;
a fine looking fellow he was, too; and he felt so terribly
about his father’s failure, that he immediately left the
village; and where should he go, accidentally, but to
the very man who purchased Mr. Merritt’s property,
and who employed him as a clerk. He happened to suit
his employer exactly—for, as I said before, he is a fine
looking fellow—and somehow or other he found out
lately that young Warden was so much attached to
Mr. Merritt’s Emma; and what does he do but give
William a deed in full of all the property, and resigned
business in his favor, then sends him off to Illinois, to
marry the daughter, and bring back the whole family
to their old home. And, sure enough, last night they
came, bag and baggage, and have commenced housekeeping
already. Young Warden and his wife, are
the handsomest couple I ever saw. I hear that they
are to give a party to their old friends as soon as they
are settled.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look sober this morning,” said I to my neighbor
Lincoln one day. “What’s the matter? Any
thing wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I can’t exactly say that,” he replied, with unusual
gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if you were under a mountain of
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I?” And he made an attempt to laugh; but it
was not entirely successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m only a little worried just now; but it will
pass off,” he added. “I get into these states sometimes—periodically,
I might say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I understand. Imaginary troubles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no,” he quickly replied. “Not just that.
There is something like real flesh and blood about the
matter. The fact is, to come out plain, Mrs. Lincoln,
in her over-kindness, has presented me with another
baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are so unreasonable as to grumble about
it! You don’t deserve to have blessings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is such a thing as being blessed to death,
you know,” said Mr. Lincoln, smiling; but the smile
was still, as they say, on the wrong side of his mouth.
“Five babies were enough, in all conscience, without
adding a sixth. It was as much as I could do to get
bread for what I had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He who sends the mouths will send the bread.
Never fear for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. This general trust in Providence is all
well enough. But it takes more mental stamina than
I possess to bring it down into particular applications.
My faith isn’t overly strong. If I were worth a hundred
thousand dollars, the babies might come as fast
as they liked. I wouldn’t call a baker’s dozen too
many. No. I like babies; bless their hearts! but I
like them properly cared for. If I live, I suppose all
will be well enough. But life is held by the most uncertain
tenure. Upon my daily exertions depend the
sustenance of my family. If I were to die my wife
and children would be in a sad way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get your life insured,” said I promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lincoln shook his head and looked grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shouldn’t like to do that.” His face became still
more serious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any particular objection?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like running in the face of Providence. I
should feel as if I were signing my death warrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a strange notion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s just as I feel. I’ve thought about it a number
of times. But it seems to me that life is too serious a
thing to be placed on a common level with a house or
a ship. In putting a money-value upon his earthly existence,
it seems to me that the Divine Being would
be outraged, and visit the mercenary offender with
death as a judgment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a strange idea of the Divine Being,” said
I, evincing surprise in turn. “In getting your life insured,
would you purpose evil to your neighbor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but rather good. I would seek, in doing so,
not only to keep my wife and children from becoming
a burden upon others, but to secure to them those
worldly advantages so necessary to the healthy development
of mind and body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you think a merciful God would visit you,
vindictively, for acting with such an unselfish purpose
in your mind? How strange must be your notion of
Him who is represented to us as being in his very
nature love! Now, we know that love seeks to impart
a blessing to all—not a curse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is such a thing as running in the face of
Providence, and this life insurance has always struck
me as being something of the kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by running in the face of
Providence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doing something in order to counteract the Divine
purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the Divine purpose in regard to
yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; of course not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, how can you, knowingly, do any thing to
counteract that purpose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t, knowingly; but I may do so ignorantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you think that the Lord sometimes punishes
men for acts innocently done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such an idea has been in my mind. Man is responsible
for his acts, and should, therefore, be very
guarded about what he does. His ignorance will not
always excuse him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose your child were to do something wrong,
yet you had the clearest evidence in your mind that
his intentions were good, and not evil; would you
punish him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would regard his intentions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because they made the quality of the act so far as
he was concerned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you make God less reasonable, considerate,
and just than yourself? Does not He also regard the
motives which influence his children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—yes—I suppose He does. But—we ought
to be very sure that our motives are right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I grant you that, with all my heart. We must
take care that we are not consenting to the death of
the saints, under the mad hallucination that we are
doing God’s service. But, with reason and revelation
for our guide, we need not be in much fear of going
wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I suppose not. Still, I can’t get away from
the idea suggested. I feel as if to insure my life would
be trifling with a solemn matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that life might fail you in consequence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
“Such is the impression, I must confess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must, then, think that the providence in regard
to the time of a man’s death is arbitrary and capricious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand much about the matter; and my
very ignorance makes me fearful,” replied Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be plain to you, on reflection,” said I, “that,
in a matter so important as the fixing of a man’s eternal
state by death, the divine wisdom and mercy of the
Lord must be exercised in a most perfect manner, so
to speak. That, in fact, no one is called to pass from
a natural into a spiritual state of existence, except at
the time when such a change will be best for him.
The mere circumstance of making an insurance upon
the life, with a view to providing for those left behind,
who would, perhaps, suffer great evils but for
such a provision, could not precipitate this time; for
the act could not foreclose a man’s state and prevent
his further regeneration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lincoln admitted that there was some force in this
view, but said he could not see the subject clearly, and
was afraid to act in the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six months afterward, on meeting my neighbor, his
serious face induced me to ask after the cause of his
trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worried about my affairs, as usual,” said he. “The
fact is, I have but little peace of mind. Every thing is
so uncertain. By this time I ought to have had a neat
little property laid up, but am not worth a copper.
My family has increased so rapidly, that it has taken
every thing I could make to feed and clothe them. If
I were certain of living, I would not feel troubled; for
I can earn a comfortable support. But no man has a
lease of his life. It makes me heart-sick to think of
the consequences if I were to die. What would become
of my wife and children! I have not a cent to
leave them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you get your life insured? Take out
a policy of five thousand dollars, for, say seven years.
It will cost you only about ninety dollars a year; and
you can easily save that much from your income by a
little extra economy. Your mind would then be comparatively
easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five thousand dollars would be a nice little sum
to leave,” said Mr. Lincoln, “and would help a great
deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could pay the premium easily enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then make the insurance by all means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have thought of it several times since we conversed
on the subject; but some how or other have put
it off from time to time. I must do so no longer. My
doubts as to the propriety of life insurance, which I
expressed some time ago, I do not feel as strongly as
then. I thought a good deal of what you said, and
came to the conclusion that your views were pretty
nearly correct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life is uncertain. We can only call the present
our own. Be wise, then, and make this provision for
your family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must do it,” said Lincoln, as he left me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you effected that insurance yet?” said I to
him a few months afterward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I have not,” he replied, “but I must do it.
The fact is, when it comes to the pinch, the amount of
premium is something. A man hasn’t always got
ninety dollars to spare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True. But didn’t I see a new sofa and a set of
mahogany chairs going into your house a week or
two ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they cost, no doubt, a hundred dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it not have been wiser—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what you would say,” interrupted Lincoln.
“Yes, it would have been wiser. The possession of
a policy for five thousand dollars would give me a far
greater pleasure than I have yet derived from looking
at or sitting upon my new chairs and sofa. The old
ones were comfortable enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t put it off any longer. Better take out a
policy for two thousand five hundred now, if the
amount of premium is an object, and another policy for
a like sum in two or three months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do that,” said he, speaking earnestly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We parted. A month or two afterward, I alluded
to the matter again. The insurance had not been made,
and Lincoln seemed a little annoyed at my reference
to the subject. After that I avoided any further remark
touching the advantages of life insurance when
in company with Lincoln. But I never met his wife,
a fragile looking creature, that I did not feel an emotion
of pain at the thought of her being left destitute,
with six children clinging to her for support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly a year elapsed from the time of my last reference
to the subject of life insurance, when news
came to the city that, while bathing on the sea-shore,
Lincoln had been drowned. The sad event was made
sadder in my mind, as my thoughts turned, involuntarily,
to his wife and children, left without a protector
and provider. What were they to do? Lincoln had
been engaged in the business of a real estate broker.
At his death, there was no estate to settle up—no store
to sell out—few if any debts to collect. The office
would be closed, and the income cease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor woman! what is she to do?” said I to myself
a dozen times in the first hour that elapsed after I
had heard the afflictive news. “Without fifty dollars
in the world, probably, besides furniture and clothing,
how is she to maintain, by her own unaided exertions,
a family of six children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much was I afflicted by the occurrence, that I
could not sleep for some hours after retiring to bed in
the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next morning the newspapers contained a
notice of the accident, with this announcement:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are happy to state, that a few days before
leaving for the sea-shore, Mr. Lincoln had his life insured
in the Girard Life Insurance and Trust Company,
for five thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was so much affected in reading this, that my
hands trembled, and the paper dropped from them to
the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some years have elapsed since the occurrence of
this sad event. Almost daily I pass a small store in a
well frequented street, behind the counter of which is
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
sometimes seen the widow of Mr. Lincoln, or a
daughter who has attained the age of fourteen years.
The face of the former has a sober, quiet look, but
bears no evidence of distressing care. Under the advice
and assistance of friends, four thousand dollars of
the money received at the death of her husband, were
safely invested in six per cent. securities, and with the
balance, a small store was stocked with goods. The
interest on four thousand dollars paid her rent, and the
profits on her little business enabled her to meet the
real wants of her family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How different would all have been but for this life
insurance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the name of one of the mouths of the Mississippi
River. At the distance of 105 miles below
New Orleans by the course of the river, and 90 miles
in a direct line, this majestic stream enters the Gulf of
Mexico by several mouths, the principal of which are
the Belize, or North East Pass, in latitude 29° 7' and
longitude 80° 10' West, and the South West Pass, in
latitude 29° 8' North and longitude 89° 25' West. The
depth of water on the bar at each of these passes is
12 to 16 feet, but much greater without and a little
within the bar. Most vessels enter and leave by the
Belize, and hence the frequency with which we hear
this remarkable place referred to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tall erections in the engraved view are look-outs
constructed for observing the approach of vessels, and
hoisting signals. The country about the Balize is one
continued swamp, destitute of trees, and covered with
a species of coarse reeds, from four to five feet high.
Nothing can be more dreary than a prospect from a
ship’s mast while passing this immense waste.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE GREAT AUK. (<span class='it'>Alca Impennis.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Auk is the vernacular name for certain sea-birds of
the family <span class='it'>Alcasæ</span>, known scientifically as species of
the subgenera, <span class='it'>Alca</span>, <span class='it'>Fratercula</span>, <span class='it'>Mergulus</span> and <span class='it'>Phaleris</span>.
The true Auks, though properly oceanic birds,
scarcely ever leaving the water except for the purposes
of reproduction, can run, though awkwardly,
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
on foot, when pursued on land. They breed in caverns
or lofty cliffs, laying but one large egg. They feed on
fish and other marine animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first of the genus <span class='it'>Alca</span> is the Great Auk, remarkable
for the imperfect development of its wings.
It seldom leaves the regions bordering on the Arctic
and <a id='antar'></a>Antarctic Circles. The wings, perfectly useless
for flight, are very serviceable as oars. Mr. Bullock
relates that during his tour to Northern Isles, one of
them, with his four oars, left a six-oared boat of pursuers
far behind. Newfoundland is one of their
breeding places, and the Esquimaux make clothing of
their skins. They are never seen beyond soundings;
and seamen direct their measures according to their
appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The length of the bird is less than three feet. The
winter plumage, which begins to appear in autumn,
leaves the cheeks, throat, fore part and sides of the
neck white. In spring the summer change begins to
take place, and confines the white on the head to a
large patch, which extends in front and around the
eyes; the rest of the head, the neck and upper plumage
is of a deep black.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>RAZOR-BILL. (<span class='it'>Alca Torda.</span>)</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the second species of <span class='it'>Alca</span>, the Black-billed Auk,
Razor-bill, or Murre, the development of the wings is
carried to the usual extent necessary for flight, though
the bird uses them with great effect as oars, when
swimming under water. They are diffused over the
northern hemisphere on both continents; but they are
particularly abundant in the higher latitudes. In England
their eggs are esteemed a great delicacy, for
salads especially, and on the coast of that country the
“dreadful trade” of taking their eggs is actively carried
on. In Ray’s Willoughby, the habits of the
Razor-bill are thus described:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It lays, sits and breeds up its young on the ledges
of the craggy cliffs and steep rocks by the seashore,
that are broken and divided into many, as it were,
stairs or shelves, together with the <span class='it'>Coulternebs</span> and
<span class='it'>Guillemots</span>. The Manks-men are wont to compare
these rocks, with the birds sitting upon them in breeding
time, to an apothecary’s shop—the ledges of the
rocks resembling the shelves, and the birds the pots.
About the Isle of Man are very high cliffs, broken in
this manner into many ledges one above another, from
top to bottom. They are wont to let down men by
ropes from the tops of the cliffs, to take away the eggs
and the young ones. They take also the birds themselves,
when they are sitting upon their eggs, with
snares fastened at the top of long poles, and so put
about their necks. They build no nests, but lay their
eggs upon the bare rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the coasts of Labrador they abound, and thousands
of birds are there killed for the sake of the
breast feathers, which are very warm and elastic, and
the quantities of eggs there collected amount to almost
incredible numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The summer and winter dresses of the Razor-bill,
though different, do not vary so remarkably as the
plumage of many other birds. In the summer dress,
the white streak which goes to the bill from the eyes
becomes very pure; and the cheeks, throat and upper
part of the front of the neck are of a deep black, shaded
with reddish. In winter the throat and fore part of
the neck are white.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Razor-bill is fifteen inches long. The egg is
disproportionately large, being about the size of that
of the turkey, but longer, white or yellowish and
streaked with dark brown.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PERILS OF THE IMAGINATION.</h2>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i133.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0007' style='width:90%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My dear Jeremy</span>,—I place before you the perils of a
passage to a Turkish Paradise, because you have shown
a passion for turbans, meerschaums and pretty women,
and I wish to warn you. The narrow path of Christian
theology is still further reduced, you see, in the Mohammedan,
so that, sinner as you are, you will find it advisable
to stick to the true faith, and to practice it with
more diligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You should not let your imagination run riot—it will be
the ruin of you; but take the substantials, with thankfulness,
which are yours by possession, and enjoy them to
the uttermost. We all—the poorest of us—have enough
and to spare of the gifts of Providence to make somebody
envious—the veriest slave of money, who boasts of his
millions, I’ll warrant me, looks with discomfort upon
your superior intellect, or your better appetite, and would
part with a good slice of gold, for a taste for a fine poem,
or a relish for roast-beef—and I doubt much whether you
would bargain them off at his valuation. I would not
give a good temper and a cheerful disposition for all the
gold that any crabbed old miser may have in his bank
vault; nor my troop of true friends for the hungry faces
of his poor relations. Would you? Your shilling or
mine will buy us more pleasure, with a friend, than he
can impart, with a one per cent. discount. This is true—and
yet the world does not look upon things thus philosophically.
We strain our imaginations to catch at some
supposed good, something we <span class='it'>fancy</span> would make us
blessed, discarding the real good that God has imparted
to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
“You wish to travel, do you?” said an old friend of
mine. “You are very silly! there is no pleasure in that.
I once went all the way to Saratoga, with my family, but
I <span class='it'>saw it all</span> in half an hour, and left in the return train.
The young folks <span class='it'>imagined</span>, that by staying two or three
weeks, something else might be discovered, and I left
them to experiment; but I was done with it, and was off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You say this never happened. By Jove, it did though!
and a sensible old codger he was <span class='it'>in his way</span> too—though I
found <span class='it'>that</span>, in the end, was rather eccentric and uncertain.
But he adhered to his opinion, and traveled no
more. “As for traveling for pleasure,” said he, “it is
absurd. I am ten times more comfortable and happy at
home, where I can call for what I want, and get it, and
instead of sweating in a stage-coach, on a hot and dusty
day, with my knees squeezed into a perfect jelly, I throw
up the back window that opens on the garden—wheel up
a recumbent chair—place another for my feet—call for a
bottle of champagne and a cigar, and with ice at my
elbow, take mine own ease, at <span class='it'>mine own</span> inn. Then, as
for traveling to see fine prospects, if I tire of the garden
and the champagne, I can shut my eyes here—<span class='it'>he never did
in his counting-room</span>—and can call up more splendid
scenery than the Rhine can boast—can crown the hills
with finer palaces than ever shone in Greece—and people
them with prettier women than Mahomet will find in his
Paradise, I’ll warrant him: And all this while your sight-seeing
traveler is perhaps toiling and puffing up the sides
of Vesuvius, over hardened lava, or is blowing his fingers
on the sides of Mont Blanc, which, I dare say, are flattered
in the engravings, while I can add in imagination
unnumbered beauties the artists never dreamed of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is good philosophy in this, Jeremy, and as it suits
my pocket just now, if you will send over the champagne,
I’ll try it. There is a home doctrine about it that I like,
for my experience is, that a man gets into very little mischief
while he stays there. How does it tally with
yours?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farther we wander in chase of forbidden pleasures,
the more impressive is the conviction that we are in pursuit
of bubbles, which go dancing and dazzling on, and
when grasped, are empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet the world is but a vast army of bubble chasers,
with here and there a sage smiling at, or rebuking, the
folly. Each has his fatuity—each his blind passion, his
bubble of the imagination. Fortune, Fame, Pleasure,
how many do they beckon away from comfort, peace and
happiness? Amid the press upon each crowded avenue,
how few are allowed to turn back! How many fall and
are trodden down forever! and yet the sanguine multitude,
rushing over the bodies of the slain, heed not the fall of
their companions, but press on as eagerly as before after
vanishing shadows. Why is it, that when happiness itself
is basking at our feet, imploring acceptance, that with a
blind fatuity we rush at any cost on misery? Is it because
the mind is ever, in this world, after the unattainable,
that we see fortune, fame, domestic comfort, personal
ease, all shipwrecked, on all sides of us in life, to attain
the undesirable? That the merchant with his bank-roll
of tens of thousands, squanders all in one wild effort to
grasp a bubble upon an unknown sea. That the man of
letters, to whom God has given an intellect but a little
lower than that of angels, and who might model and
mould the mind of a nation to good, and shine as a star in
the intellectual firmament, to be worshiped in all time by
the students of genius, “who follow her flashing torch
along every path to knowledge”—knowing his high gifts
for good, and feeling their power, scorns the possession,
and scatters the bale-fires of a mighty intellect, as a volcano
showers down lava and ashes, upon mankind—blighting,
as with a destroying angel’s touch, the fair world in
which he lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the domestic hearth, with children merry-voiced,
over which meek-eyed Peace hovered like a dove, and
around which Heaven’s own smile seemed to linger, is
treacherously invaded by the demon of jealousy, green-eyed
and furious, until Crime, with swarthy countenance
and bloody locks, broods with Death’s Angel over the silent
spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Perils of the Imagination, how they invest the unsatisfied!
Are these the penalties which God imposes for
unthankfulness? or is it that the devil, ever working at
the heart, urges man to ingratitude, and excites him to
folly? What think you, Jeremy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is undoubtedly pleasant in the midst of the weakening
influences of an August day, to sit, <span class='it'>sub tegmani fagi</span>, and
read of the sports of the watering places—the wonders of
Niagara, or the discoveries of those summer travelers who,
turning aside from the beaten paths, or common haunts of
fashion, explore the hidden, and develop the unknown.
Most agreeable is it to mingle the mental sherbet of our
summer’s retirement with such timely ingredients. Herein
our brethren of the daily press seem to have an advantage
over us of the monthly issues, as, day by day, they prepare
their ever welcome table, and are never compelled to
speak of an elevated thermometer, while</p>

<p class='line0'>And Dick, the shepherd, blows his nails.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Waiving this advantage, or to speak more correctly, yielding
to this disadvantage, we purpose laying upon our table,
and for our readers who dine later than the common class,
a single dish, composed of gleanings from the flower-gardens
and the stubble-fields, in a late visitation among the
“wise men of the East.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We say nothing of a rest which we set up for a short
time in New York, because the continual clatter in that
Babel of this land would prevent ordinary ears (and ours
are of no extraordinary length) from hearing any thing
worth presenting here, and the dust, which seemed to be
moving in solid masses from corner to corner, rendered
quite necessary to comfort and to future speculation hermetically
closed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next stage was Springfield, Mass., where we saw
and conversed with <span class='sc'>Grace Greenwood</span>—a Grace for
which we were appropriately grateful. She was cultivating
ideas for future use, and gathering thoughts to sustain
her fame and secure the admiration of others. She was
successful, undoubtedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Springfield has <span class='it'>of</span> itself, as well as <span class='it'>in</span> itself, attractions
of no ordinary character. The regular tourist will, of
course, visit and describe the Armory, in which are stored
about one hundred thousand stand of arms, all rendered
nearly useless, by the introduction, since <span class='it'>they</span> were manufactured,
of percussion caps, instead of the old flint and
steel process of igniting the charge. In these days every
thing must be done quickly. A rail-road of a hundred
miles in length, and five millions cost, was constructed
between two cities, because it would carry passengers in
one hour’s time less than one already in use. And here
the ignition of the powder by the spark from the flint,
which seemed to measure the shortest imaginable <span class='it'>space</span>,
we had almost said <span class='it'>point</span> of time, was deemed, and undoubtedly
is, too slow a process for destroying human life;
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
and so another agent is applied, whose operation is electric,
and makes the intention and the act instantaneous. These
guns thus put into coventry, must have cost nearly twelve
hundred thousand dollars—a sum, the interest of which we
wish we had to pay contributors, literary and artistic, to
Graham’s Magazine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because the genius of our people is connected with the
fact, we will just add, that at this place, as at other of the
armories of the General Government, all the parts of the
muskets are so constructed as to suit any one musket of
the million that may be made. No single part is particular;
no screw has a special gun; no spring, clasp, or brace, is
intended to suit one, or two, or twenty, but each part of
any musket will answer for the same part of any others
without alteration of any kind. This looks like the perfection
of mechanism, and the machinery used looks as if
it were made by and for such perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one who visits in Springfield will neglect the large
public cemetery; it is worth a visit of miles—and it requires
the travel of miles, for it is large. Good taste and ingenuity
are manifested in all its parts; and the buried, if
they have a consciousness of their whereabout, must be
satisfied to await, in that beautiful retreat, the summons
which shall call together the separated bones, and clothe
them anew with the incorruptible, in which they are to
stand and be judged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the living will learn in this beautiful city of the
dead, to contemplate the only certainty of their lives, and
to see the slow approach of their dissolution, without that
shock which the Golgothas and Aceldamas of other times
were sure to impart to the delicate and sensitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know that the cynic loves to point to the ornamented
grave-yard, or the magnificent cemetery, as the exhibition
of the pride of the living—the vanity of the survivors.
And I dare not say, that even with the chastened, holy
feelings which grief ensures, some particle of human vanity
may not mingle, and that the monument which professes
to record the virtues of the dead, may not, indeed, betoken
the pride of the living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But suppose it does—admit the charge, and what then?
The pride of the living is shown where no future error of
the lauded will belie or disgrace the memorial, and where
the self-esteem which is gratified in the erection of the
cenotaph, will never be wounded by the ingratitude of the
one that sleeps beneath. Let vanity have its hour if it
uses the time to praise the virtuous, and make death less
repulsive; and pride which beautifies where dead men’s
bones and all manner of uncleanliness once were found,
commends itself to forgiveness, if it may not command
our approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Has any one ever thought of this? All know and applaud
the movement which develops and displays the
virtues and beauties of our nature. But who has thought
it worth while to commend the undertaking that makes
the errors and deformities of our character minister to
taste and refinement! The polished marble scarcely requires
genius to give it a sightly and ornamental position;
it is beautiful wherever found, but true taste and true skill
are requisite to give symmetry and collective beauty to
rough ashlars in an ornamental tenement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When such a cemetery is established, it is natural that
the private and parishional burying-places should yield up
the dead, and be devoted to the more active business of
life; and hence we see in various departments of this
ground, old moss-grown stones that have followed the
dust whose history they record, and who stand among the
newly-carved pillars and slabs now become representatives
not less of the taste than of the people of other times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wandering in the lower part of the town, near the railroad
<a id='dep'></a>dépôt, I saw on the main street, a lot newly broken
up for building. It had been the burying-ground of some
church or family. One old stone was laid aside. It recorded
the name of a virtuous woman, who died more
than two hundred years ago. This is the antiquity of our
country, and the existence of a grave-stone of that date is
a part of the marvel of the present time. I was about to
copy the record, but I saw some one watching me, and as
I shrunk from being gazed at, I ceased from the labor. I
might have brought away a part of the <span class='it'>words</span>, though nothing
but an artist could have caught and conveyed the
form of the letters, if that could be called <span class='it'>form</span> which was
almost formless. Surely every age has its <span class='it'>literature</span>; and
perhaps every location claims its peculiar style. Certainly
the literature of the early part of the seventeenth century
in Springfield had some striking peculiarities. I do not
remember seeing previously the word <span class='it'>pietously</span>, which, if I
mistake not, was on that stone—and that, too, without the
necessity of rhythm. Yet most beautifully did the uncouth
rhyme and shapeless sculpture of that stone, convey
to the readers, the merits of a woman who lived in Springfield
when that town was a wilderness, and whose virtues
made that “wilderness blossom like the rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Springfield to Brattleboro’, Vt., is only three
hours’ ride; but he who enters the smallest inn of an
interior village in a drenching storm at night, and leaves
it the next morning before the mists that night and the
storm engendered have climbed up the mountain sides,
and gone to mingle with the world of misty fogs above,
can have but little to say of persons or places, excepting,
indeed, that he may acknowledge that a clean bed and a
well-supplied and well attended table exceeded the promise
of the house; and that the quiet, orderly, self-respecting
deportment of mechanics employed in the neighborhood,
illustrate the fact elsewhere derivable, that idleness,
champagne, and white gloves, are not necessary to
the character of a good republican citizen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is the celebrated water cure establishment of Dr.
Woeselhooffer—and it is stated that cures are really by
water effected. Some oblong wicker vessels, which were
visible in the baggage car of the train, seemed to intimate
that entire dependence is not placed on <span class='it'>water</span> by every one
in this village, though we have seldom seen a place more
liberally supplied with the pure element.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In looking along the sea-shore of Massachusetts, one is
struck with the spirit of these times as contrasted with
those of other years. Jutting out upon the bold, rocky
promontories, are seen the beautiful summer residences of
the wealthy, while each stream, formerly kept open and
clear by law for the ascent and descent of migratory fish, is
now dammed and swollen, to augment water power. Whole
towns, cities indeed, are spread out upon the inclined
surfaces, that only a few years back were deemed unfit for
cultivation, and consequently unworthy of consideration,
while at the entrance to each port and harbor is seen some
old fort, which, fifty years ago, would, in the midst of profound
peace, bristle with the glittering bayonet of men-at-arms;
and each morning and evening pour out the formal
thunder that bespeaks the character of the fortress and the
rank of its commander. Now the façade is trodden by the
horse and cow that are seeking fresh pasture, and the ramparts
are broken by the <span class='it'>borrowing</span> of the material for some
neighboring cottage or factory; and within, where the
stately tread of the sentinel showed order and produced
propriety, the absence of all monitions of war, and the dilapidation
of all barracks and tenements show that men
have come to think of peace as the proper state of society,
and to regard war as such a remote contingency that the
expenditures necessary for defense may be postponed to
the time when defense may be suggested by aggression.
We do not profess to be members of the peace party, but
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
we should strangely mistake the signs of the times if we
did not understand that they indicated a settled confidence
of peace at home, not unsustained by the belief that no
nation of the earth has the least desire to run their heads
against the people of this country. It is the agreement of
the people of the United States as to the value and importance
of republican institutions, which gives invincibility
to our arms; and foreign powers are wise enough to inquire
not how many forts stand in front of seaboard towns,
but how many hearts in town and country beat for the
land and its institutions. Forts may be demolished by
force, or betrayed by treason, but no combination of foreign
power could tread out the institutions of this country, no
considerable number of citizens be found faithless to the
nation. Other people know this and do not ask for ramparts
and armaments. Our own people know, and feel
secure in the patriotic vigor of each and of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Massachusetts is a great country of villages, if, indeed,
it would not be more correct to say, that nearly all of New
England is a suburb of Boston. There are no <span class='it'>townships</span>
of unoccupied lands in Massachusetts, and where, a few
years prior, a stream gushed out of a swamp, turgid with
the colors of the leaves and roots steeped in its waters,
new villages take the place of the swamp, and the stream
is seen busy with the people grinding at the mill, while
from each steeple another is visible; each school-house is
within sight of its like, and the well-leaved trees scarcely
conceal from the inhabitants of one village the white and
green of the cottages of the next town. Where such a
population is found one scarcely looks for large forms or
extensive homesteads; each rood of ground serves to contain
and maintain its man, and the intellect of each is kept
bright by the constant collision of mind with mind, and
the constant necessity of vigilance to prevent encroachments
or to secure the advantages of a bargain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one goes to the south-eastern part of Massachusetts
without inquiring at least for the “farm” of Daniel
Webster. It was my better lot to visit the place, and to
see much of what others have of late read of. Mr. Webster
purchased a large farm, which, having been in the
same family almost ever since the landing of the Pilgrims,
had not been disturbed by those divisions which augmented
population and factory privileges effect in other parts of
the state, and as the Anglo-Saxon race is remarkable for
the desire to add land to land, Mr. W. has yielded to that
propensity of his blood, and augmented his domains, by
the annexation of two other overgrown or rather undivided
farms, so that the public road seems made to divide
his land for miles, and to open up for general admiration
the beautiful improvements which his taste supports, and
his liberality exercises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am not going to give any account of Mr. Webster’s
place for the benefit of the agricultural society, else would
I speak of his gigantic oxen, and his conquest over fell and
rocks; else would I describe his swine, that seem, like the
ox of the Bible, to know their owner, and to feel the consequence
of such domination; else would I tell of the hundred
bushels of corn which were brought forth by an acre,
which ten years ago seemed to share in the common attributes
of the soil of the state, viz., to present in summer
the contest between a stratum of paving pebbles and some
stunted grass for visibility; a contest which ceased at the
approach of cold weather, when, of course, the stone became
most prominent, and continued so until the snow for
five months buried both parties out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Webster is as fond of the ocean as of the land, and he
gathers the riches of the deep for his pleasure as well as
the fatness of the earth—that is, the wild fowl and the sea
fish are as successfully pursued by Mr. W. as are his agricultural
objects, so that with his broad land around him,
and the deep blue of the sea beyond, he sits, monarch of
all he surveys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is in the form of Mr. W. something like himself—it
is the result of industry—it is immense—it has upon it
no finical decoration, no tawdry ornaments, no pretty
little hiding-places, but its wide avenues lead to immeasurable
oaks and elms, and far and wide useful habitations,
luxuriant fields, and lordly herds of cattle speak the great
proprietor; and with all Mr. Webster’s intellectual greatness
he feels that even in that nook of New England he is
among men who can measure his intellect and attainments,
and whose respectful salutations and deferential bearing
are not due to any indefinable awe for some mysterious
power, attainment, or possession, but the result of a
just perception of his worth, and a correct appreciation
of his mental greatness and political sagacity. Mr.
Webster has, of course, a magnificent library—the treasures
which great minds have yielded, and a great
mind gathered—a library worthy such a man—a library
appropriate to such a princely residence. But it is not
the only one. Within a short distance, I saw on many
shelves, in the extreme building of a frame rope-walk, not
four miles from Mr. Webster, a collection of books in seven
or eight languages, which would make the mouth of a
literary epicure water; beautiful editions of valuable
works, curious collections also, and desirable copies, every
one of which was familiar to its modest owner, who seemed
to know every vein in his rich mine, and to be able to give
the exact value of the product of each inch of its contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have said that Massachusetts was the extension of
Boston; it is in more ways than in the beauty of residences
and the uses of wealth; not the least worthy of
notice is the conformity of country with the city in the
delicacy of the female mind, and the extent of refined
female education, among classes which might in other
parts of the country, have escaped the meliorating influences
of early discipline in manners, morals, and graces;
and the visiter to the villages of Massachusetts, who finds
his way into the parlor in <span class='it'>all</span> seasons, will be delighted
with the enlarged influences of correct education, and the
evidences of entire compatibility of the most extensive
literary attainment and feminine polish with the discharge
or direct supervision of domestic duties.</p>

<hr class='tbk125'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A New Volume</span> of this Magazine will be commenced
in January, in a style commensurate with the liberal and
still increasing patronage bestowed upon it. We know
that our patrons are fully satisfied with our past exertions
to gratify their tastes, and we are equally confident that
they will take our word when we assure them that excellent
as the present volume has been, the forthcoming one
will eclipse it in splendor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The season is now close at hand for subscribing to literary
periodicals, and the formation of new clubs. Let us
urge upon those who design patronizing this Magazine, to
send in their orders for the new volume at an early day.
Although we shall print a large edition of the first numbers,
it may, and doubtless will happen—as it did last year—that
the supply will be totally exhausted, and disappointments
occur in consequence of our inability to furnish
complete sets of the numbers. This can be effectually
guarded against by an early subscription for the new
volume, and we hope our friends and the public generally
will bear this suggestion in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have in course of preparation some exquisite large
engravings, suitable for framing, designed as premium
gifts to new subscribers, and from which a selection can be
made. The particulars will be given in our Prospectus
for the new volume, which will shortly appear.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Oliver Goldsmith: A Biography. By Washington Irving.
New York: George P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From no living person could we have expected a more
delightful biography of Goldsmith than from Washington
Irving, and, accordingly, we have one, written closer to
the heart and brain of its subject, than any other in English
literature. There are two biographies of Goldsmith
with which it will naturally be compared, Prior’s and
John Forster’s, both of them works of merit, but neither
equal to Irving’s in respect to felicity in conveying to the
reader a living impression of Goldsmith’s character and
life; and of depositing his image softly in the mind, as an
object of good-natured affection. Prior is invaluable for
materials, not only in regard to facts but epistolary correspondence,
and displays in his style of composition no
sign of being word-forsaken; but he has little juice in
him, is hard and dry of mind, and exhibits no vision into
the soul of Goldsmith, no capacity to clutch the living
lineaments of his character. Forster’s biography is a
work of more intellectual pretensions; and the narrative
of Goldsmith’s life, the criticism on his various works,
and the numerous anecdotes relating to the politics and
literature of the time, are done with an ability we could
not but expect from a man of Forster’s mental powers
and accomplishments: but unfortunately the subject was
one in which his mind had little real sympathy, and, accordingly,
the whole book, as far as it refers to Goldsmith,
is pervaded by affectation and sentimentality. The style
is made up of Carlylisms and Macaulayisms, and further
depraved by a sickly cant of sympathy with the poor—which
cant bears evidence of being written by a man in
extremely comfortable circumstances. But Irving is, in
intellectual constitution, sufficiently like Goldsmith to
comprehend him thoroughly, and his biography, therefore,
has the truth and consistency of dramatic delineation,
without any parade of knowledge or sentiment. With
exquisite refinement of thought, and simplicity of narrative,
it exhibits the gradual growth of Goldsmith’s mind
and disposition under the tutorship of experience, and so
clear is the representation, that the dullest eye cannot
miss seeing the essential features of the character, and the
dullest heart admiring them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is almost needless to say that the style is lucid,
graceful and pure, with that “polished want of polish”
in the selection of the words, which indicates a master in
diction. The spirit breathed over the work is genial and
sympathetic, and while it throws a charm around Goldsmith,
makes the reader in love with Irving. The selections
from Goldsmith’s letters and writings, introduced
as illustrations of events in his life, and qualities of his
character, do not stand apart from the biographer’s text,
but rather seem to melt into it, and form a vital portion
of the work. Irving has avoided the fault of the other
biographers, in not admitting extraneous matter, and rejecting
every thing which does not strictly relate to Goldsmith.
The sketches of men, and descriptions of English
life and manners, which he introduces, are all illustrative
of the circumstances and position of his author. Among
these, the remarks on Johnson, Langton and Topham
Beauclerc, and the account of the Literary Club, are the
most felicitous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the last chapter of the volume, Irving sums up, with
great delicacy and discrimination, the various qualities of
Goldsmith, and presents, with a loving pen, his claims
upon the reader’s esteem. We cannot refrain from quoting
the concluding remarks, both for their beauty and
justice. “From the general tone of Goldsmith’s biography,
it is evident that his faults, at the worst, were but
negative, while his merits were great and decided. He
was no one’s enemy but his own; his errors, in the main,
inflicted evil on none but himself, and were so blended
with humorous, and even affecting circumstances, as to
disarm anger and conciliate kindness. Where eminent
talent is united to spotless virtue, we are awed and dazzled
into admiration, but our admiration is apt to be cold
and reverential; while there is something in the harmless
infirmities of a good and great, but erring individual, that
pleads touchingly to our nature; and we turn more kindly
toward the object of our idolatry, when we find that, like
ourselves, he is mortal and frail. The epithet so often
heard, and in such kindly tones, of ‘poor Goldsmith,’
speaks volumes. Few, who consider the real compound
of admirable and whimsical qualities which form his
character, would wish to prune away its eccentricities,
trim its grotesque luxuriance, and clip it down to the
decent formalities of rigid virtue. ‘Let not his frailties
be remembered,’ said Johnson, ‘for he was a very great
man.’ But, for our part, we rather say, ‘let them be remembered,’
since their tendency is to endear; and we question
whether he himself would not feel gratified in hearing his
reader, after dwelling with admiration on the proofs of
his greatness, close the volume with the kind-hearted
phrase, so fondly and so familiarly ejaculated, of <span class='sc'>Poor
Goldsmith</span>.”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Bulwer and Forbes on the Water Treatment. Edited, with
Additional Matter, by Roland S. Houghton, M. D. New
York; Geo. P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume is published especially for the benefit of
literary and professional men, to whom the editor dedicates
it. As it is addressed “to those who think,” there
is a natural disposition on the part of the reader to think
with the editor. The most entertaining piece in the volume
is Bulwer’s letter, in which the author of Pelham,
after describing the melancholy condition of his health
under the regular practice, gives his experience as a
Water Patient. The other articles are more elaborate
and learned disquisitions on Hydropathy, written by physicians;
and whatever may be the opinion of the reader
as to the merits of the water cure as a medical science, he
cannot fail to obtain much valuable information about
bathing, and many strong inducements to look after the
health of his skin.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Story of a Genius, or Cola Monti. New York: D. Appleton
&amp; Co. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a little story somewhat after the manner of Miss
Sedgwick’s delicious juvenile tales, evidencing not merely
a laudable purpose in the moral, but no mean powers of
characterization, and a considerable knowledge of practical
life. Cola, the slight dark-eyed Italian boy, the genius of
the story, and Archibald McKaye, the youth marked out
for a mercantile profession, are both well delineated; and
the idea of bringing them together as natural friends is an
anticipation of that union between artist and merchant
which we trust will soon be more common in real life.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span></p>
<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Child’s First History of Rome. By E. M. Sewell,
Author of Amy Herbert, &amp;c. New York: D. Appleton
&amp; Co. 1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Miss <a id='sew'></a>Sewell has performed, in this little volume, a difficult
task, showing throughout that she understands what
few authors of children’s books seem to comprehend—a
child’s mind. A series of histories, composed on similar
principles, would be a positive and permanent addition to
the literature of youth. The authoress, not being “above
her business,” but having her audience constantly in her
mind, has succeeded in avoiding every thing which would
make her narrative obscure to children, and her style
mirrors events in the light they ever appear to boys and
girls. The account of the death of Cleopatra is one out of
many examples of this felicity. In the following extract
the very tone of a child’s mind is caught and expressed.
“Shortly afterward an officer arrived from Octavius. The
first thing he saw when he entered the room was Cleopatra,
dressed in her royal robes, stretched lifeless upon a
golden couch. She had killed herself by means of an asp,
a kind of serpent, which was brought to her in a basket
of figs, and the sting of which was deadly. Iras was
lying dead at the feet of her mistress; and Charmian,
scarcely alive, was placing a crown upon her head.
‘Was this well done, Charmian?’ inquired the messenger
of Octavius. ‘Yes,’ replied Charmian, ‘it is well done,
for such a death befits a glorious queen.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volume, in addition to the simplicity of its narrative,
bears evidence of having been compiled from good
authorities; and if extensively read by the juvenile public,
will be likely to make most children more informed in
regard to Roman history, at least, than the majority of
parents.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>A Lift for the Lazy. New York: Geo. P. Putnam.
1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Few readers will have modesty enough to acknowledge
publicly that this brilliant volume is addressed to them,
but doubtless a great many, convicted by conscience, will
take a sly peep into it to see if it really meets their wants.
In truth, the author has contrived to embody in it much
curious information, which the most industrious scholars
have either forgotten or never acquired. It contains about
five hundred scraps of knowledge, collected from a wide
field of miscellaneous reading, some of which are valuable,
some quaint, some sparkling, and all entertaining. We
have only space to extract one specimen of the author’s
style, and that illustrative of his way of relating an anecdote.
Under the head of “Congreve Rockets,” he remarks,
“These destructive implements of war were invented in
1803, by Sir William Congreve. On a certain occasion,
when visiting Westminster <a id='abb'></a>Abbey, in company with some
ladies, his attention was directed by one of the party to
the inscription on the great composer, Purcell’s monument:
‘He has gone to that place where only his music can be
excelled.’ ‘There, Sir William,’ said the young lady,
‘substitute <span class='it'>fire-works</span> for <span class='it'>music</span>, and that epitaph will answer
for yourself.’ ”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Scenes where the Tempter has Triumphed. By the Author
of “The Jail Chaplain.” New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.
1 vol. 16mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a book, replete with morality and religion, in
which a view of human nature is taken as it appears to an
observer posted in a jail or on the gallows. There are
nineteen chapters, each devoted to the narrative of a different
person and a different crime, and each as interesting
as one of Ainsworth’s novels, and as moral as one of
Baxter’s Sermons. A book which thus addresses two
large classes of readers can hardly fail to succeed. We
should think it an admirable text book for Sunday-Schools
in Texas. It places before every criminal’s eye a more
or less distant view of the jail and gallows, and is thus
really “an awful warning to the youth of America,” and
differs essentially from the “Pirate’s Own Book,” “The
Lives of Celebrated Highwaymen,” and other piquant
books of the rascal department of letters.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Stars and the Earth; or Thoughts upon Space, Time,
and Eternity. Boston: Crosby &amp; Nichols.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a small volume of eighty-seven pages crammed
with thought. It appears to have excited much attention
abroad, and to have passed rapidly through three editions.
The speculations of the author are grand and original,
having a solid basis on undoubted facts, and conducting
the mind to results of “great pith and moment.” We
have no space to make an abstract of what is in itself an
epitome, but advise all our readers, who have thought on
the subject of space and time, to obtain the work. Its
style is a transparent medium for the thought, and its
meaning stupidity itself can hardly miss. It requires
neither a knowledge of mental or physical science to be
comprehended, though it is an addition to both; and it
removes some difficulties which have troubled all reflecting
minds.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Retribution; or the Vale of Shadows. A Tale of Passion.
By Emma D. E. Nevitt Southworth. New York: Harper
&amp; Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Judged by its own pretensions as a tale of passion, this
work has considerable merit, and is worthy of a more permanent
form than the pamphlet in which it is published.
The mode which the Harpers have adopted of issuing all
novels in this uncouth shape, in order to reduce their price
to twenty-five cents, is an unfortunate one for the success
of a new novelist like the accomplished authoress of the
present story. No man of taste, who has regard for his
eyesight, is likely to read pamphlet novels, unless the
author be celebrated; and the circulation of a book like
the present, is therefore likely to be confined to persons
who are not in the habit of discriminating very closely
between one novelist and another, provided both be readable,
and consume a certain portion of leisure time.
Whenever an American author produces a work of fiction
as meritorious in respect to literary execution as “Retribution,”
it ought to be issued in a form which will
enable it to take its appropriate place in American literature.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>History of the United States of America. By Richard Hildreth.
New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. Vol. 2. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume ends at about the commencement of the
Revolution. It is written in the same style, and on similar
principles, as the first volume, which we noticed a short
time ago. The work is, at least, worthy the praise of
condensation, there being included in the present volume,
a narrative of the events occurring in all “the Colonies
during the period of a hundred years.”</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Letters from the Allegheny Mountains. By Charles Lanman.
New York: Geo. P. Putnam. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this agreeable volume is well known
as an essayist and tourist. The present work is mostly
made up of letters originally contributed to the National
Intelligencer, and, as a record of first impressions of
scenery and manners, has a raciness and truth which a
more elaborate treatment of the subject might have wanted.</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
